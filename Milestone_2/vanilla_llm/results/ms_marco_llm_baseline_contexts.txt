What is a manufacturing corporation, within the meaning of the law, is not even yet fully known.||Understanding what a corporation is becomes essential as they influence job creation, innovation, and market dynamics, shaping the livelihoods and futures of countless individuals.||What these requirements are depends on the kind of corporation involved.||[38] The political theorist David Runciman notes that corporate personhood forms a fundamental part of the modern[when?]||[citation needed]

A corporation's spatio-temporal positioning is legislatively arbitrary to its formation.||The corporation is then governed by the laws of incorporation in that state.||Registration is the main prerequisite to the corporation's assumption of limited liability.||Ownership and control

[edit]

A corporation is, at least in theory, owned and controlled by its members.||Instead, the two elements of a corporation that define its legislative identity and are therefore nonarbitrary delimitations to its formation and existence are which jurisdiction (or sets of jurisdictions in the case of international corporations) it belongs to, and what subject area or areas it performs activities within.||If stock is issued, the corporation will usually be governed by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly.||If a corporation operates outside its home state, it is often required to register with other governments as a foreign corporation, and is almost always subject to laws of its host state pertaining to employment, crimes, contracts, civil actions, and the like.||The second is a potentially uninterrupted, essentially infinite lifespan for the business.||Kocaoglu, Kagan (Cahn Kojaolu) A Comparative Bibliography: Regulatory Competition on Corporate Law

Kyd, S, A Treatise on the Law of Corporations (1793–1794)

Mahoney, PG, "Contract or Concession?||Transfer and sale of stock is also tightly controlled.||A two-tiered committee structure with a supervisory board and a managing board is common in civil law countries.||The most common model is a board of directors which makes all major decisions for the corporation, in theory serving the best interests of the individual shareholders.||This is contrasted with a sole proprietorship, which may experience problems and complications should the owner die, while a corporation allows for the seamless passing on of the business.||A single committee known as a board of directors is the method favored in most common law countries.||This limitation of liability is one of the many advantages to incorporation, and is a major draw for smaller businesses to incorporate; particularly those involved in highly litigated trade.||[citation needed]

Generally, a corporation files articles of incorporation with the government, laying out the general nature of the corporation, the amount of stock it is authorized to issue, and the names and addresses of directors.||In Canada, this possibility is taken to its logical extreme: many smaller Canadian corporations have no names at all, merely numbers based on a registration number (for example, "12345678 Ontario Limited"), which is assigned by the provincial or territorial government where the corporation incorporates.||The first is the substantial legal and fiscal protection in the event of litigation or bankruptcy.||Finally, there is the threat du jour: corporations and the technologies they promote."||A company is incorporated in a specific nation, often within the bounds of a smaller subset of that nation, such as a state or province.||In a joint-stock company the members are known as shareholders, and each of their shares in the ownership, control, and profits of the corporation is determined by the portion of shares in the company that they own.||Indeed, the Japanese-owned corporation has set a horrible precedent.||A corporation may issue stock, either private or public, or may be classified as a non-stock corporation.||An exception is treasury stock, where the company essentially buys back stock from its shareholders, which reduces its outstanding shares.||A corporation is an organization—usually a group of people or a company—authorized by the state to act as a single entity (a legal entity recognized by private and public law as "born out of statute"; a legal person in a legal context) and recognized as such in law for certain purposes.||In theory, a corporation cannot own its own stock.||In Defense of the Corporation.||This essentially becomes the equivalent of unissued capital, where it is not classified as an asset on the balance sheet (passive capital).||In most circumstances, a shareholder may also serve as a director or officer of a corporation.||Shareholders do not typically actively manage a corporation; shareholders instead elect or appoint a board of directors to control the corporation in a fiduciary capacity.||[37]

Legal scholars and others, such as Joel Bakan, have observed that a business corporation created as a "legal person" has a psychopathic personality because it is required to elevate its own interests above those of others even when this inflicts major risks and grave harms on the public or on other third-parties.||Co., Missouri Corporation that manufactures plumbing products.||Where local law distinguishes corporations by their ability to issue stock, corporations allowed to do so are referred to as stock corporations; one type of investment in the corporation is through stock, and owners of stock are referred to as stockholders or shareholders.||From Project Gutenberg

And this may be done by a corporation through its properly organized officers.||Global Reach: The Power of the Multinational Corporation.||those who are considered the owners of a non-stock corporation are persons (or other entities) who have obtained membership in the corporation and are referred to as a member of the corporation.||Registered corporations have legal personality recognized by local authorities and their shares are owned by shareholders[3][4] whose liability is generally limited to their investment.||Under this model, the board of directors is composed of both executive and non-executive directors, the latter being meant to supervise the former's management of the company.||A corporation stands as a powerful player in the global economy, embodying a legal entity with rights akin to an individual.||Historically, some corporations were named after the members of their boards of directors: for example, the "President and Fellows of Harvard College" is the name of one of the two governing boards of Harvard University, but it is also the exact name under which Harvard was legally incorporated.||From Project Gutenberg

Any person who owes debts, or business corporation, may become a voluntary bankrupt.||Legal entity incorporated through a legislative or registration process

For other uses, see Corporation (disambiguation).||[27]

The day-to-day activities of a corporation are typically controlled by individuals appointed by the members.||[32] Their use puts everybody on constructive notice that they are dealing with an entity whose liability is limited: one can only collect from whatever assets the entity still controls when one obtains a judgment against it.||In the United States, forming a corporation usually required an act of legislation until the late 19th century.||The Corporation Under Russian Law: A Study in Tsarist Economic Policy (1991)

What does a Forensic Science Technician do?||Find out what professionals in the chemical sciences do each day in specific roles.||Forensic Scientists do not attend crime scenes (except for firearms examiners, who are often also police officers do attend scenes as do members of the lab who analyze explosives and clandestine labs) but receive the evidence from the Ident officers and then analyze the evidence and submit a report giving their opinion of the weight of the evidence.||What Forensic Science Technicians Do About this section

Forensic science technicians aid criminal investigations by collecting and analyzing evidence.||They do NOT determine personality from handwriting.||I applied to do an applied chemistry degree instead.||They do not require, nor usually like a forensic science background.||So although we do work together, it’s not the way it’s portrayed on CSI or Silent Witness, say, where they play a large part of the forensic investigation team.”

Neither do forensic scientists spend their time at crime scenes looking for clues – a job done by the Socos, who, Sheridan explains, are police officers primarily involved in “visiting crime scenes, looking for any evidential links and collecting and correctly packaging any worthy exhibits”.||Forensic Pathology: Even schools that do not offer degree programs in forensic science often offer courses specific to the field.||Forensic Scientist Duties & Responsibilities

Forensic scientists are required to handle the following work:

Collaborate with crime scene investigators

Handle crime scene evidence

Classify and organize evidence

Analyze evidence

Report findings

Document findings

Testify in court

Forensic science technicians do their work in a laboratory setting for the most part.||What is a Forensic Science Technician?||Searching one piece of clothing can take hours.”

But perhaps the most important thing is to understand the job, says Sheridan: “You need to be aware that it’s very different to the way it’s portrayed on the TV.”||At crime scenes, forensic science technicians typically do the following:

Analyze crime scenes to determine what evidence should be collected and how

Take photographs and make sketches of the crime scene

Record observations and findings, such as the location and position of evidence

Collect evidence, including weapons, fingerprints, and bodily fluids

Catalog and preserve evidence for transfer to crime labs

Reconstruct crime scenes

In laboratories, forensic science technicians typically do the following:

Perform chemical, biological, and microscopic analyses on evidence taken from crime scenes

Examine results of DNA analyses of biological substances, such as hair and skin cells, and other evidence for their significance to investigations

Consult with experts in specialized fields, such as toxicology (the study of poisons and their effect on the body) and odontology (a branch of forensic medicine that concentrates on teeth)

Prepare technical reports, including statistical analyses of forensic evidence

Operate, maintain, and clean laboratory facilities and equipment

Forensic science technicians typically need a bachelor’s degree to enter the occupation.||Such scientists have a core scientific background in the field in which they are working.||OTHER SPECIALISTS – There are many other scientists that may be involved in forensic science.||In addition to working in police laboratories, forensic science technicians might work with coroners or in morgues.||Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as to retire.||“You need to be able to ask questions and keep an open mind, or you won’t get the breakthroughs,” she says.||To perform independent casework, technicians may need to pass a proficiency exam through their state government or otherwise be approved by a laboratory or accrediting body.||Other police officers are involved in such things as interviewing suspects and following up leads.||Some of these are police labs, such as the RCMP labs across the country and some are independent from the police, such as The Centre of Forensic Sciences and the Laboratoire de sciences judiciaires et de medecine legale.||Forensic scientists work in laboratories and are responsible for conducting complex examinations of physical evidence collected from crime scenes.||Other workers who analyze crime scenes and criminal evidence include police and detectives and digital forensics analysts.||Ident officers used to require at least 7 years service in the police force, before entering the training and understudy period in Ident.||Forensic science technicians maintain the integrity of evidence, and their work is essential for providing forensic scientists with material for analysis.||Forensic scientists not only analyze evidence but also interpret results, generate reports, and may serve as expert witnesses in legal proceedings.

If you are experiencing any of the symptoms listed below, then you may have a gastric ulcer.||Misoprostol can cause miscarriages when given to pregnant women and should be avoided by women of childbearing age.||List of Symptoms

The signs and symptoms of gastric ulcers are almost opposite to the signs and symptoms of duodenal ulcers – the main differences are noticed in the timing and severity of the pain.||Gastric ulcer

This one forms in the lining of the stomach.||These ulcers occur in both men and women, and affect about 4.6 million people every year.||A peptic ulcer of the stomach is called a gastric ulcer; of the duodenum, a duodenal ulcer; and of the esophagus, an esophageal ulcer.||Gastric Ulcers – all symptoms listed here

Plus we reveal 10 facts about treatments that they don’t tell you about…

Fortunately, the symptoms of gastric ulcers are fairly simple to identify.||A peptic ulcer is a sore or erosion that develops in the gastrointestinal tract, and may or may not cause painful symptoms.||Gastric ulcers generally cause a dull aching pain, often right after eating

Light exercise can often cause an increase in pain

Fatigue – heavy blood loss from a gastric ulcer may lead to anemia, which can in turn cause fatigue

Indigestion and heartburn, or acid reflux

Nagging pain in the upper abdomen area below your breastbone

Episodes of nausea

A noticeable loss of appetite

Unplanned weight loss

Another less common symptom of a gastric ulcer is that about 3 in every 10 people are woken up at night by dull ulcer pains – this usually happens 3- 4 hours after eating

What causes Gastric Ulcers?||We will also show you why treatment of gastric ulcers is not aimed at the ulcer itself or your symptoms, but rather in removing the root cause of the problem – this being an infection of h. pylori bacteria.||Peptic ulcer disease is very common all across the globe, affecting approximately 4.6 million people every year, including both men and women.||Speaking of women, about 8%-11% women are likely to develop peptic ulcers at some point of time and the percentage of men under that risk being within the range of 11%-14%.||If you suspect you have a gastric ulcer you should see your doctor for a proper diagnosis.||The good news is that a recent breakthrough in natural medicine now makes it possible for you to easily eliminate the cause of your gastric ulcer.||In some cases, these symptoms strike because the ulcer is causing a blockage in the stomach and food isn’t able to pass easily into the small intestine.||It is very important to keep a track on your symptoms, especially when you suspect the presence of a peptic ulcer.||However, ignoring peptic ulcer symptoms, if any, or not getting treated in time, may cause inflammation in the abdominal cavity.||Peptic ulcer other symptoms and signs that are less common include:

Bloating

Burping

Feeling sick to your stomach

Poor appetite

Vomiting

Weight loss

Even if your symptoms are mild, you may have a peptic ulcer.||(Kick-start your new, healthy routine with Women's Health's 12-Week Total-Body Transformation!)||Endoscopy is useful in establishing the diagnosis of obstruction from an ulcer and excluding gastric cancer as the cause of the obstruction.||H2 blockers

Studies have shown that a protein released in the stomach called histamine stimulates gastric acid secretion.||Symptoms

Not everyone will experience symptoms, or, the same kind of symptoms.||Have you have already had a bad experience with previous treatment for a gastric ulcer, or any other treatment for helicobacter pylori that failed?||Symptoms and signs of peptic (esophageal, duodenal, or stomach) ulcer disease vary.||In the past, H. pylori was found in more than 80% of patients with gastric and duodenal ulcers.||The bacterium releases an enzyme called urease, which neutralizes the hydrochloric acid (HCl), a gastric acid in the stomach.||The most common symptom of a peptic ulcer is a dull or burning pain in the stomach.||In less than 20% of cases gastric ulcers can be caused by an anti-inflammatory medicine.||You may be thinking right now that by having a gastric ulcer, you have a fairly severe health problem, but the reality is that this is no longer the case.||With appropriate symptoms, a clinician may perform a urea breath test checking for H. pylori.||This is one of the most serious symptoms of peptic ulcer disease, which might indicate that the ulcer has perforated the wall of the stomach or duodenum.||(If you already have an ulcer, however, both can make your symptoms worse.)||This list of symptoms is not definitive and should be used as a guide only.||Diagnosis

After understanding your symptoms, the doctor would conduct some tests to confirm the presence of peptic ulcer disease.||Bibliography & References

These articles relate to the symptoms of all types of ulcers found in the gastrointestinal tract;||While proton-pump inhibitors are comparable to H2 blockers in effectiveness in treating gastric and duodenal ulcers, they are superior to H2 blockers in treating esophageal ulcers.||While H2 blockers are effective in ulcer healing, they have a limited role in eradicating H. pylori without antibiotics.||There is a lot more you need to know about gastric ulcers and H.||A peptic ulcer (stomach or duodenal) is a break in the inner lining of the esophagus , stomach, or duodenum.||Other Symptoms

Other symptoms which may be observed include – fatigue, paleness, and hunger pangs.||In some patients, gastric obstruction can be relieved by suction of the stomach contents with a tube for 72 hours, along with intravenous anti-ulcer medications, such as cimetidine (Tagamet).||Indigestion

Indigestion is another common symptom of peptic ulcer that causes a burning sensation somewhere in the middle of the chest.||What are the early symptoms of peptic ulcers?||Endoscopy

This test is usually done on patients showing severe symptoms of PUD like vomiting, weight loss, difficulty in eating, etc.||The most common location of a peptic ulcer is the duodenum, whereas, ulcers in the esophagus are relatively rare.||Ulcers formed in the stomach are known as gastric ulcers, and ulcers formed in the duodenum, which is the upper portion of the small intestine, are known as duodenal ulcers.||Some people with stomach ulcers do not have any symptoms or signs while others may have a few or several.||The primary symptoms to look out for are pretty non-specific (translation: they can be caused by a variety of conditions besides ulcers), says Ravella, so it’s important to check in with your doc if you ever experience any of the following five issues:

Official Church teaching on marital love and sexual matters

[edit]

According to the Church, humans are sexual beings whose sexual identity extends beyond the body to the mind and spirit.||Moreover, we are obliged to ask the Magisterium to explain how the doctrine of “mutual submission” should be reconciled with the constant teaching of the Church on the roles of husband and wife in holy marriage, since we know that God cannot contradict Himself.||It simply acknowledges that there are limits to how far natural scientists can extrapolate from presently-observed material processes back into the remote past.||Are the faithful to conclude that the traditional teaching on the spiritual headship of the husband and father has been abrogated, because it is not explicitly affirmed in the Catechism of the Catholic Church?||I think that it would be helpful for the reader to pause for a moment and reflect on the question, “Does the treatment of family roles contained in the 1994 Catechism of the Catholic Church and its silence on the spiritual headship of the Catholic husband and father abrogate the traditional teaching of the Church summarized in Casti connubii?” How one answers this question is crucial for any constructive discussion of the Church’s authoritative teaching on creation and evolution.||While the current Magisterium can change a teaching that falls under non-infallible ordinary magisterial teaching, nevertheless, when the Magisterium makes a judgment in these cases, it has an obligation due to the requirements of the moral virtue of prudence to show how the previous teaching was wrong or is now to be understood differently by discussing the two different teachings.||"[71] The sacrament of matrimony is viewed as God's sealing of spousal consent to the gift of themselves to each other.||"[71] The sacrament of matrimony is viewed as God's sealing of spousal consent to the gift of themselves to each other.||Since no authoritative Magisterial teaching has ever abrogated the constant teaching of the Church on the God-given roles of husband and wife in the family, Catholics are obliged to uphold the traditional doctrine.||One way to reconcile the two is to recognize that a Catholic husband and father must submit himself to the spiritual and material needs—not wants!—of his wife and children, while his wife and children should submit to his authority in all things but sin.||This paper will summarize the traditional authoritative teaching of the Catholic Church on creation, evaluate the claim that recent Popes have officially endorsed theistic evolution, and show why Catholics are fully justified in holding fast to the traditional doctrine of creation.||Moreover, when Pope St. John Paul II wrote that husbands and wives should practice "mutual submission" he did not explain how his exhortation could be reconciled with the constant teaching of the Church on the roles of husband and wife prior to his pontificate.||Incest, or "rape of children by parents or other adult relatives" or "those responsible for the education of the children entrusted to them" is considered the most heinous of sexual sins.||Incest, or "rape of children by parents or other adult relatives" or "those responsible for the education of the children entrusted to them" is considered the most heinous of sexual sins.||Or does the informed Catholic have an obligation to evaluate the more recent teaching in the light of the constant teaching—the “traditional doctrine”—of the Church?||Ripperger highlights here, consider a fundamental element of the Church’s traditional teaching on the roles of husband and wife in the family which is not explicitly affirmed in the 1994 Catechism—that is, the God-given role of the husband and father to be the spiritual head of his wife and children.||[45] The wife and children of the priest were thrown out of their house,[46] and the priests could be thrown in a monastery for the remainder of their lives and their wife and children enslaved.||[45] The wife and children of the priest were thrown out of their house,[46] and the priests could be thrown in a monastery for the remainder of their lives and their wife and children enslaved.||If so, does this mean that Catholic fathers are no longer the spiritual heads of their families?||For 600 years, according to the foremost Catholic Doctors and commentators on this dogmatic decree, the words “at once from the beginning” signified that God created all of the different kinds of corporeal creatures and angels “simul” (“at once”).||The equality of men and women is reflected in the Church teaching that the sexes are meant by divine design to be different and complementary, each having equal dignity and made in the image of God.||The equality of men and women is reflected in the Church teaching that the sexes are meant by divine design to be different and complementary, each having equal dignity and made in the image of God.||[61]

Sexual morality

The Catholic Church teaches that human life and human sexuality are inseparable.||In spite of the fact that this has been the constant authoritative teaching of the Church from the time of the Apostles until now, it is nowhere to be found in the 1994 Catechism of the Catholic Church.||As our nation marks the anniversary of the tragic Supreme Court decision, Roe v. Wade, we as Catholic Christians must pray for a change of heart in all citizens and courageously teach and defend the sanctity of human life, particularly that of the defenseless, innocent unborn children.||This is considered contrary to the dignity of persons and of human sexuality because it is not ordered to the good of spouses or the procreation of children.||This is considered contrary to the dignity of persons and of human sexuality because it is not ordered to the good of spouses or the procreation of children.||In reality, the traditional teaching of the Catholic Church—upheld by all of the Fathers and Doctors without exception—has been that the origin of man and the universe is not a question for the natural sciences but for theology.||According to the Roman Catechism, “Creator of heaven and earth” in the Creed also referred to the creation of all of the different kinds of living things.||All clergy who are bishops form the College of Bishops and are considered the successors of the apostles.||All clergy who are bishops form the College of Bishops and are considered the successors of the apostles.||Throughout her history, the Church has always held that an authoritative Magisterial teaching must take precedence over a less authoritative teaching on the same topic, especially when the latter teaching is ambiguous or contradicts the prior teaching.||The sexual act, according to the Church, is sacred within the context of the marital relationship that reflects a complete and lifelong mutual gift of a man and a woman.||The sexual act, according to the Church, is sacred within the context of the marital relationship that reflects a complete and lifelong mutual gift of a man and a woman.||According to research form scholars, "We do not and cannot know for certain who first conceived the idea of the female-led Vela Perpetua.||According to research form scholars, "We do not and cannot know for certain who first conceived the idea of the female-led Vela Perpetua.||Now, if the traditional distinction between creation and providence is correct—and the unanimous teaching of all of the Fathers must be correct on a point of this kind—all the efforts of natural scientists to demonstrate or to observe “the origin of species” in nature or in the laboratory are doomed to failure.||Von Hildebrand has given the simple reason why the special creation of Adam and the creation of Eve from Adam’s side, among other doctrines derived from Genesis 1-11, are authoritative and unchangeable Catholic doctrine.||In other words, according to St. Thomas and all the Fathers, natural processes and operations are not themselves instances of God’s creative activity; rather, they show His Providence at work in maintaining His prior work of creation, which is presupposed by the way these processes and operations now take place.||Fruit flies are still fruit flies, and all of the forms produced through induced mutations are inferior to the non-mutant forms.||Athenagoras (177) in his "A Plea on Behalf of Christians" (a defense against paganism) emphasized that Christians consider as murderers those women who take medicines to procure an abortion; he condemns the killer of children, including those still living in their mother’s womb, "where they are already the object of the care of divine providence."||The overriding Jewish teaching upheld the sanctity of the life of the unborn child.||This statement was all the more remarkable in light of the fact that the Pontifical Academy of Sciences has long refused to give any serious consideration to the scientific evidence against the evolutionary hypothesis, while defending a number of positions on other issues that are highly questionable from a Catholic point of view.||The teaching of the Catechism of Trent was upheld by the Magisterium well in to the twentieth century.||[47][49][50] While the Spanish military was known for its ill-treatment of Amerindian men and women, Catholic missionaries are credited with championing all efforts to initiate protective laws for the Indians and fought against their enslavement.||[47][49][50] While the Spanish military was known for its ill-treatment of Amerindian men and women, Catholic missionaries are credited with championing all efforts to initiate protective laws for the Indians and fought against their enslavement.||Basil in a letter to Bishop Amphilochius (374) clearly pronounces the Church’s teaching: "A woman who has deliberately destroyed a fetus must pay the penalty for murder" and "Those also who give drugs causing abortions are murderers themselves, as well as those who receive the poison which kills the fetus."

During Shrovetide, many churches place a basket in the narthex to collect the previous year's Holy Week palm branches that were blessed and distributed during the Palm Sunday liturgies; on Shrove Tuesday, churches burn these palms to make the ashes used during the services held on the very next day, Ash Wednesday.||Many Christian congregations thus observe the day through eating pancakes or, more specifically, the holding of pancake breakfasts, as well as the ringing of church bells to remind people to repent of their sins before the start of Lent.||[19] In many Christian parish churches, both Protestant and Roman Catholic, a popular Shrove Tuesday tradition is the ringing of the church bells (on this day, the toll is known as the Shriving Bell) "to call the faithful to confession before the solemn season of Lent" and for people to "begin frying their pancakes".||[2][3]

Shrove Tuesday is observed by many Christians, including Anglicans, Lutherans, Methodists and Roman Catholics,[4] who "make a special point of self-examination, of considering what wrongs they need to repent, and what amendments of life or areas of spiritual growth they especially need to ask God's help in dealing with.||[45][46]

Orthopedic Nursing Salaries

In December 2010, Scrubs Magazine reported that orthopedic nursing was the eighth highest paying nursing specialty, paying an average annual salary of $81,000.||Orthopedic nurses can function as generalists, providing care to all patient populations for a wide range of conditions, and can further specialize in a number of different orthopedic interventions, areas, or disorders:

Congenital musculoskeletal disorders

Foot and ankle surgery

Joint reconstruction

Metabolic disorders

Neuromuscular disorders

Orthopedic oncology

Spine surgery

Sports medicine

Advanced practice registered nurses practice orthopedics as a subspecialty, and many who pursue this area of practice have a background in orthopedics before beginning advanced practice.||Students interested in the orthopedic subspecialty are advised to request a clinical rotation in the area of practice during their MSN or DNP programs.||Advance Practice Orthopedic Nurse Education

===========================
People with amoebas in their intestines can pass the infection to others through stool (poop) even if they have no symptoms.||The anti-fungal drug kills the amoebas so that they can't cause further damage.||Symptoms

The very few people who become infected with brain-eating amoebas usually die because the infection and inflammation caused by the organisms are difficult to diagnose and treat, said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.||[7]

Prognosis

[edit]

In the majority of cases, amoebas remain in the gastrointestinal tract of the hosts.||Millions of people are exposed to brain-eating amoebas each year, but very few people get sick, according to the Mayo Clinic.||Another drug that is currently being tested for the treatment of brain-eating amoebas is miltefosine, also known by its trade name, Impavido.||"Brain-eating amoebas are not something the general public should worry about if they are swimming in chlorinated pools," Roos said.||What Are the Signs & Symptoms of Amebiasis?||Because amoebas may contaminate food and water, you can help prevent the illness by being careful about what you eat and drink, especially in developing countries.||[2] Infections without symptoms may be treated with just one antibiotic, and infections with symptoms are treated with two antibiotics.||The symptoms for the amoeba infection vary depending upon the classification of organism.||After the start of symptoms, people die in less than a week.||For others, symptoms can take months to appear.||Hospitals most commonly treat brain-eating amoebas with the anti-fungal drug amphotericin B; it is typically injected into a vein or into the space around the spinal cord, according to the Mayo Clinic.||[2] Bacterial colitis can result in similar symptoms.||For some people, symptoms of amebiasis can begin within days to weeks of swallowing contaminated food or water.||Symptoms appear two to 15 days after a person has been exposed to the amoeba, and are nonspecific; doctors often have trouble finding the cause of a person's symptoms, according to the Mayo Clinic.||Serological tests exist, and most infected individuals (with symptoms or not) test positive for the presence of antibodies.||Some other symptoms of this infection include the following, according to the Mayo Clinic:

A change in sense of smell or taste

Sensitivity to light

Loss of balance

Vomiting

Confusion

Sleepiness

Sudden, severe headache

Seizures

Hallucinations

Fever

Stiff neck

However, more often than not, these symptoms are caused by other conditions.||An 8-year-old who suffered a brain-eating amoeba infection was diagnosed and treated several days after symptoms.||Symptoms can range from mild diarrhea to dysentery with blood, coupled with intense abdominal pains.||[2] Symptoms may include lethargy, loss of weight, colonic ulcerations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or bloody diarrhea.||In one case, a 12-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital 30 hours after experiencing symptoms.||Often, a dog’s condition will progress without outward symptoms, with evidence of illness only being apparent at the crisis stage.||[3][4] Amoebiasis can be present with no, mild, or severe symptoms.||Diagnosing the infection is difficult, because initial symptoms are general: headache, fever, nausea or vomiting.||Symptoms usually include nausea and a general ill feeling, and progressive impairment of thinking and activities, which eventually lead to coma, Schaffner said.||Even with treatment, patients often die within a week after their symptoms start, according to the Mayo Clinic.||In many cases, the parasite that causes amebiasis lives in a person's large intestine without causing any symptoms.||It is theorized that the absence of symptoms or their intensity may vary with such factors as strain of amoeba, immune response of the host, and perhaps associated bacteria and viruses.||[7] About 480 million people are currently infected with about 40 million new cases per year with significant symptoms.||[14] Those with symptoms require treatment with two medications, an amoebicidal tissue-active agent and a luminal cysticidal agent.||Because this organism flourishes in canines with a suppressed immune system, the possibility of an infection by acanthamoeba should be considered in a sick pet when similar symptoms are present.||Symptoms take from a few days to a few weeks to develop and manifest themselves, but usually it is about two to four weeks.||[19]

Treatment

[edit]

Main article: Amoebicide

E. histolytica infections occur in both the intestine and (in people with symptoms) in tissue of the intestine and/or liver.||[2]

Signs and symptoms

[edit]

Most infected people, about 90%, are asymptomatic,[9] but this disease has the potential to become serious.||Call your doctor if anyone in your family has signs or symptoms of amebiasis, such as:

diarrhea with blood or mucus

diarrhea that lasts longer than 2 weeks

belly pain

a fever

a swollen belly

pain or tenderness in the area of the liver (below the ribs on the right side)||Acanthamoeba

Canines infected by the inhalation of the organisms in the air, or through the nasal cavity by swimming in affected stagnant water, may present the symptoms below:

Muscle stiffness

Lack of appetite

Breathing difficulties

Discharge from the eyes

Distressed mental state

Lack of energy

Seizures

It has been documented that a dog showing effects of Acanthamoeba may present signs of irritation of the head and face, such as pawing at the muzzle and eyes.||Entamoeba Histolytica

A dog who has ingested drinking water contaminated by human feces, or who has been exposed to the amoeba in unsanitary conditions by the handling of food for example, will exhibit some or all of the following symptoms:

Listlessness

Halitosis (bad breath)

Weakness

Vomiting

Diarrhea

Dry spots or sores on the nose and legs

Oral mucus membranes may be covered with mucus

A severe case also documented hair loss, brittle hair shafts and thickened, hardened skin on the neck.||A fresh sample may show the presence of the organism within 30 minutes of commencement of the diagnostic test.||In 1998 there was an outbreak of amoebiasis in the Republic of Georgia.||Severe ulceration of the gastrointestinal mucosal surfaces occurs in less than 16% of cases.||The initial location of the parasite is in the mucosa of the large intestine, causing dysentery (an inflammation of the intestine that causes bloody diarrhea).||Cutaneous amoebiasis can also occur in skin around sites of colostomy wound, perianal region, region overlying visceral lesion and at the site of drainage of liver abscess.||[2] Effective treatment against all stages of the disease may require a combination of medications.||Lectins help in the attachment of the parasite to the mucosal layer of the host during invasion.||As E. dispar is much more common than E. histolytica in most parts of the world this means that there is a lot of incorrect diagnosis of E. histolytica infection taking place.||Those diagnosed with a brain-eating amoeba infection are often given a cocktail of drugs for greater chance of survival.||[citation needed]

Stool antigen detection tests have helped to overcome some of the limitations of stool microscopy.||The amoeba is also capable of penetrating the walls of tissues and organs, such as the liver and kidneys.

How is energy use and cost changing?||As for our Inside Energy focus states:

Colorado homes use 687 kWh and spend $84 per month

North Dakota homes use 1,240 kWh and spend $113 a month

Wyoming homes use 863 kWh and spend $91 a month

How is energy use and cost changing?||Here are a few more statistics to help you calculate your energy consumption:

A 2-ton central air conditioner uses 1450 kWh per month

A typical water heater used by a 4-person household consumes 310 kWh per month

A dishwasher uses 30 kWh per month

An oven range uses 58 kWh per month

A microwave uses 16 kWh per month

A 17-20 cubic foot refrigerator-freezer uses 205 kWh per month

A washing machine uses 9 kWh per month

A dryer uses 75 kWh per month

Lighting for a 4-5 room residence uses 50 kWh per month

A television set uses 27 kWh per month

(The above statistics are all based on average home use)

Not sure where to start?||Assuming an average electricity cost of $0.23 per kWh, that translates into about $12 per day for electricity, or $345 per month.||Average electricity consumption per month is 850 kWh.||Average Electricity Consumption Per Year, Month and Day

Here we present the average consumption for year, month and day use.||Here’s how I calculated these figures:

Amount Item 3,804,000,000,000 Total kWh consumed in US in 2020 21% Used for residential 798,840,000,000 kWh residential use in 2020 329,500,000 US population 2020 2,424 kWh per person 9,698 kWh for a family of four 808 kWh per month (family of four) 27 kWh per day (family of four) $0.23 average cost per kWh 2020 $345 cost per month (family of four) $11.50 cost per day (family of four)

That’s the average.||In 2022, the average annual amount of electricity sold to (purchased by) a U.S. residential electric-utility customer was 10,791 kilowatthours (kWh), an average of about 899 kWh per month.||You shouldn’t have to be an electrical engineer to know how much you will spend each month on power costs.||Depending on whether a state is hot or cold, urban or rural, an average household can use as little as 506 kWh a month (Hawaii) or as much as 1,291 kWh (Louisiana).||Depending on whether a state is hot or cold, urban or rural, an average household can use as little as 506 kWh a month (Hawaii) or as much as 1,291 kWh (Louisiana).||In 2009 the average was 50 kWh per day, or 1,500 kWh per month, or almost double where we are now.||Summary Table For Average Household Electricity Use Per Day, Month And Year

Here is the average household electricity summarized into a table.||Global Home Electricity Use Per Person

By taking residential electricity use and dividing it by population we can look at how much electricity the average person uses at home in each country.||As of March 2024, in the United States, the average household uses 850 kWh of electricity per month, or 10,204 kWh of electricity per year.||Average Household Electricity Use By State, and Cost Per kWh

For each state, below are the average daily kWh, average monthly kWh and average annual kWh.||If one is trying to determine usage as part of a plan for creating an alternative energy system for the house, one really needs to find out the actual usage for the house.||Nationwide, average monthly electricity use rose 8 kWh per household between 2012 and 2014 and prices rose three-quarters of a cent per kWh.||Nationwide, average monthly electricity use rose 8 kWh per household between 2012 and 2014 and prices rose three-quarters of a cent per kWh.||If you scale this number down to the requested 1600-2000 square foot house, the result is around 60,000 kWh per year.||Total Electricity usage (all applications) per year for comparison:

USA 12,000 kWh per capita

California 8,000 kWh per capita

Average of SC Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric

Household electricity use: 6,000 kWh per household per year for 3 residents average per household.||Many people in smaller towns didn’t even own a refrigerator.||Now the household of three has an equivalent of 44,000 kWh per household in transportation.||Introduction – Electricity Used By A Home

[Update 03/09/2024: we updated the average household electricity consumption figures using the latest data from EIA from 2023 which is current as of March 2024]

Do you know how much electricity your home uses per day, per month or per year?||A standard being considered by Laguna Beach is 0.23 kWh per square foot per month, which becomes

0.23 x 1500 x 12 = 4140 kWh per year.||Then on average, at any one time, your house is using 10,204 kWh divided by 8760 hours, which is 1.16 kilowatts.||How do we compare to the average?||Americans Use 5X More Power Than Global Average

Each American uses about 4,500 kWh per year in their home.||The average electricity consumption of a US family of four as of 2020 (the last full year for which data is currently available) is in the neighborhood of 27 kWh per day, or 808 kWh per month.||Below we present how we computed this and electricity use in other countries.||Of course that is an average.||And by developing-world standards Costa Rica is well off; in many other developing countries electricity isn’t even available to most people, so the average is very low.||Average electricity consumption per day is 28 kWh.||Despite having lower electricity usage, California’s higher cost per kWh results in an average monthly bill (approximately $126.03) that is comparable to states with higher usage but lower costs.||So the household use per capita is 2,000 kWh or about ¼ of per capita electricity from all applications.||How to Reduce Your kWh Usage

Reducing your kWh usage isn’t just about turning off lights.||Single Household – Instantaneous Usage

The power needs of a house at any instant then is on average 1.2 – 2.3 kilowatts.||Household Natural Gas use: 400 therms per household x 30 give 12,000 kWh equivalent electricity.||Total average household power usage:

6,000 kWh electricity plus 12,000 kWh gas equivalent = 18,000 kWh per year.||California’s Greenhouse-Gas-Free Power

The greenhouse gas free electricity production does not have to be counted in the electricity account.||And we’ll show you how to use this knowledge to find the best electricity plans for your needs.||But what about the 5,000 pound Gorillas sitting outside the house?||In states where there are many residential net-metered PV systems, the amount of household electricity consumption may be a lot higher than household electricity purchases.||Our household electricity use has been 2,000 kWh each of the last few years, which means it is about 700 kWh per person.||Average household electricity consumption per year is 10204 kWh (kilowatt hours).||In Brazil, Mexico and China per person use is just 500 kWh, but growth is very different.

A painful, burning sensation when you pee

Peeing with a UTI usually causes a painful and/or burning sensation in the urethra.||The symptoms of a bladder infection include:

painful urination and a burning sensation

needing to urinate frequently

sudden urge to empty your bladder, called urinary urgency

pain in your central lower abdomen, just above the pubic bone

blood in your urine

Certain symptoms in addition to those of a UTI could mean you have a prostate infection (prostatitis).||What Are the Symptoms of Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)?||In older adults, symptoms of UTI may sometimes be mistaken for another condition.||All can make UTI symptoms more likely.||Symptoms of a UTI that involves the kidneys can include:

pain in your sides or back that doesn’t change when you change position

fever and chills

nausea and vomiting

a burning sensation when you urinate

If you have a kidney infection and can take medication by mouth, a doctor will prescribe antibiotics.||A urinary tract infection, or UTI, is an infection in any part of your urinary system.||This won't treat the UTI – you still need an antibiotic for that.||You’ve probably heard cranberry is an effective way to ward off a UTI.||If you are experiencing symptoms of a UTI, visit a doctor or healthcare professional and have a urine test performed.||Symptoms of sepsis can include:

irregular or fast heart rate

sudden changes in body temperature

change in mental status

fever and chills

difficulty breathing

Sepsis can be caused by an infection in the urinary tract.||Chances are, it has happened to you: You go to the bathroom and feel a burning sensation when you urinate.||In contrast to young children and infants, who may have general or nonspecific symptoms, most adults experience symptoms typical for a UTI when infection is present.||Although most of the time you have burning or pain when you pass urine, it's possible to have a UTI without symptoms.||An uncomplicated UTI affects the lower urinary tract and is also known as cystitis or a bladder infection.||An uncomplicated UTI is treated with antibiotics, and people typically recover within 3 days to 6 weeks.||Once the bacteria settle in, they wreak havoc and can cause a laundry list of UTI symptoms that include:

Pelvic or abdominal pain.||Your doctor might also order a blood test (complete blood count) if they suspect an upper-tract UTI.||The symptoms of bladder infections and UTIs can be similar.||If you are experiencing symptoms and think you have a UTI, visit a doctor for treatment.||This test might be done if the dipstick test was negative but you still had symptoms of a UTI, or there was some other test abnormality.||UTI Symptoms

The symptoms of a UTI can include:

A burning feeling when you pee

A frequent or intense urge to pee, even though little comes out when you do

Cloudy, dark, bloody, or strange-smelling pee

Feeling tired or shaky

Pain in the penis or rectum (men)

Mental confusion (mostly older people)

Wetting the bed (children and older adults)

If the UTI has spread to your kidneys, you may also get:

Pain or pressure in your back or lower belly

Nausea and vomiting

Fever and chills

Types of Urinary Tract Infections

An infection can happen in different parts of your urinary tract.||Some options include taking:

A low dose of an antibiotic over a longer period to help prevent repeat infections

A single dose of an antibiotic after sex, which is a common infection trigger

Antibiotics for 1 or 2 days every time symptoms appear

A non-antibiotic prophylaxis treatment (This could include cranberry products, D-mannose, methenamine with vitamin C, or vaginal estrogen cream in menopausal women.)||If you catch a bad whiff while also experiencing the symptoms above, a UTI may be to blame.||If you have had a UTI before, a doctor might also perform an ultrasound to check for abnormalities in your urinary tract.||While the symptoms in men and women are similar, women may develop pelvic pain from a UTI, while rectal pain is not uncommon in men with UTI.||See a doctor if you are experiencing symptoms of a UTI, such as painful or frequent urination, pain in your central lower abdomen, or blood in your urine.||Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) Symptoms in Men vs. Women

In adults younger than 50, men are less likely to develop a UTI than are women, so UTI in younger adult males is uncommon.||Factors that can put you at greater risk for UTIs may include the following:

a previous UTI

long-term use of a urinary catheter

being immobile for long periods

not drinking enough fluids

recent urinary tract or kidney surgery

urinary tract blockages like kidney stones or an enlarged prostate

diabetes

being uncircumcised

fecal incontinence

engaging in anal intercourse, which can expose the urethra to more bacteria

To diagnose a UTI, a doctor will examine you and ask about symptoms, including any past history of UTIs.||Treating UTIs

Mann emphasizes that you should see a doctor or other health care provider if you experience any of the symptoms of UTI, especially pelvic pain, urinary leakage, painful urination or a frequent urge to go.||"The symptoms are usually obvious, but sometimes patients have mild symptoms," Lisa Dabney, M.D., assistant professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive science at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, tells SELF.||To help you determine whether that something is a urinary tract infection, here are the most common UTI symptoms for women you need to know.||This prescription drug is not an antibiotic and so can't treat UTIs.||Fever and chills can be present, but this is most typical of an infection that has spread higher in the urinary tract to the kidneys.||Other symptoms sometimes occur, including tenderness over the area of the bladder, pain in the low abdomen, and flank pain.||But if you have recurring UTIs, you could try D-mannose along with an antibiotic.||Symptoms may include urgency, frequency, and burning when you urinate.||They're more common in men over 50 because they may have an enlarged prostate gland.||The red berry contains a tannin that might prevent E. coli bacteria – the most common cause of urinary tract infections – from sticking to the walls of your bladder, where they can cause an infection.||You also may have to get an ultrasound to check for any abnormalities in your urinary system.||If pyelonephritis or an upper urinary tract infection is left untreated, it can lead to sepsis.||This change in bacterial makeup increases your risk of UTI.||Most people are familiar with the classic symptoms of UTI in both women and men, which include pain or burning on urination, difficulty urinating, feeling the constant or frequent urge to urinate (urinary urgency), urinating frequently, and the presence of blood in the urine (although this is not always present).||This means the bladder doesn't empty completely, increasing the chance that bacteria will grow and cause an infection.||If your symptoms don’t clear up after taking antibiotics, talk with a doctor.||This can include:

people who have a penis

pregnant people

people who are immunocompromised

older adults

people who use catheters

people who experience recurring UTIs

If you think you have a UTI, it’s best to make an appointment with a doctor.||Prompt treatment is key to relieving these symptoms and preventing possible complications, such as kidney infection.||A clinician can confirm a diagnosis and rule out other conditions that may be causing your symptoms.||UTI Complications

The amount of alcohol you need to consume to become drunk depends on the definition of "drunk" and on the individual's body weight , build and factors such as how long ago they ate.||Alcohol affects people differently, and there is no definitive way to work out how much alcohol will make a person drunk.||In many countries, it is illegal to drive with a BAC (Blood Alcohol Content) of 0.05%.||Of the 1,233 traffic deaths among children ages 0 to 14 years in 2016, 214 (17%) involved an alcohol-impaired driver.||If you’re hosting a party where alcohol will be served, remind your guests to plan ahead and designate a driver that will not be drinking or using drugs.||What safety steps can individuals take?||So for this answer, a BAC over 0.10% will be considered "drunk".||A penis pump induces the penis to fill with blood, just like it would due to a natural erection.||Your manhood needs to fill with blood to get and maintain an erection.||The supplements (Supplements) will trigger the body to produce more testosterone hormones, leading to improved sexual performance.||It is possible to estimate, based on body weight - but this is only a rough guide.||The BAC (blood alcohol content) Calculator

This blood alcohol content or BAC, for short, calculator can estimate your blood alcohol levels.||A 45kg (100lb) male after 3 drinks

A 55kg (120lb) person after 3 drinks

A 64kg (140lb) person after 4 drinks

A 91kg (200lb) person after 5-6 drinks

A 100kg (220lb) person after 6 drinks

A normal liver will metabolise one standard drink every 90mins - this means that you can take off approximately 0.01% BAC every 40mins after the drink is finished.||It is usually measured as mass per volume.||If you think you or someone you know might have a problem with alcohol, take the alcohol abuse quiz.||At this level, most people will begin to show mood changes, impairment with reflexes, staggering, slurred speech and other signs of intoxication.||Make plans so that you don’t have to drive while impaired by alcohol and/or drugs and do it before you start consuming either.||A 40kg (90lb) female will likely be intoxicated after 2 drinks.||U.S. Department of Transportation

Drinking alcohol increases your risk for liver problems.||Alternatively, you can use a penis pump (Penispumpe) or natural ED pills like MaasaLong to improve your sexual performance while the body recovers from alcohol-induced erectile failure.||Use the HealthStatus (HealthStatus DE) BAC Calculator for informational purposes only, and not to drink and drive or drink and work.||Do not ever let your friends drive while impaired even slightly.||For example:

Before drinking, designate a non-drinking driver within your group.||The keto diet (Ketogene Diät) is great for cleansing your system.||Calculator Source: Computing a BAC Estimate.||For recovering athletes, hitting the gym with legal steroids and SARMS would get you back on your levels of workout endurance and sexual performance.||The keto diet and fat burners (Fatburner) are a full regimen for getting your healthy body back.||Blood alcohol content (BAC) or blood alcohol level is the concentration of alcohol in the bloodstream.||Important Note: There is no BAC calculator that is 100% accurate.||Factors include the gender of the drinker (biologic, not identity), their differing metabolism rates, various health issues, and the combination of medications and supplements that might be taken by the drinker, drinking frequency, amount of food in the stomach and small intestine and when it was eaten, elapsed time, and other factors.||The best that can be done is a rough estimation of the bloodstreams alcohol content or the BAC level based on known inputs.||For example, a Blood alcohol content BAC of 0.04% means 0.4% (permille) or 0.04 grams of alcohol per 100 grams of individual’s blood.||Most states also have lower legal BAC limits for young and inexperienced drivers, professional drivers and commercial drivers.||The next two largest groups were ages 21 to 24 (26%) and 35 to 44 (22%).||Every state in the U.S. has a legal Blood Alcohol (BAC) limit of 0.005% or 0.08%, (depending on the state you are driving in).||This is due to the number of factors that come into play regarding the consumption and alcohol processing rates of different people.||Impaired driving as a problem:

Among drivers with BAC levels of 0.08% or higher involved in fatal crashes in 2016, nearly three in 10 were between 25 and 34 years of age (27%).||If the adverse symptoms of alcohol-related impairment to sexual performance persist, you can start with getting into diets.||Having a meal before, or during, alcohol consumption should also help to reduce the affects of alcohol.||The annual cost of alcohol-related crashes totals more than $44 billion according to the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control.||Unfortunately, drinking large amounts of alcohol can interfere with the brain’s messengers responsible for telling the penis to fill with blood.||Thankfully, if you detox, the body can recover to normal sexual function.||A testosterone booster (Testo Booster) is another crucial way to reverse alcohol-induced sexual dysfunction.||You can then use a penis ring to keep the blood from leaving the spongy erectile tissue, prolonging the induced erection.||Every day, 29 people in the United States die in motor vehicle crashes that involve an alcohol-impaired driver according to the CDC.||Erectile dysfunction is one of the adverse effects of excessive alcohol consumption.||A standard drink is approximately one shot, one glass of beer or one glass of wine.||That’s one percent of the 111 million self-reported episodes of alcohol-impaired driving among U.S. adults each year (figure below).||the same amount of alcohol usually affects females more than males.||In 2016, more than 1 million drivers were arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol or narcotics.

"The Luck of Roaring Camp" was soon included as the centerpiece of Harte's collection The Luck of Roaring Camp and Other Sketches.||And so the work of regeneration began in Roaring Camp.||Publication history

[edit]

Bret Harte and his colleague Anton Roman at the Overland Monthly were in Santa Cruz, California when "The Luck of Roaring Camp" was set in type in the summer of 1868.||[27]: 24 Harte later referred to the piece as "the worst poem I ever wrote, possibly the worst poem anyone ever wrote.||Characters

Analysis and response

[edit]

Bipolar I disorder: Doctors diagnose bipolar I after at least one manic episode.||Having one episode of mania is enough for you to receive a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.||The risk of affective switches is higher in bipolar I depression; antidepressants are generally avoided in bipolar I disorder or only used with mood stabilizers when they are deemed necessary.||The risk of affective switches is higher in bipolar I depression; antidepressants are generally avoided in bipolar I disorder or only used with mood stabilizers when they are deemed necessary.||The risk of affective switches is higher in bipolar I depression; antidepressants are generally avoided in bipolar I disorder or only used with mood stabilizers when they are deemed necessary.||The risk of affective switches is higher in bipolar I depression; antidepressants are generally avoided in bipolar I disorder or only used with mood stabilizers when they are deemed necessary.||The risk of affective switches is higher in bipolar I depression; antidepressants are generally avoided in bipolar I disorder or only used with mood stabilizers when they are deemed necessary.||[182] A more recent analysis of data from a second US National Comorbidity Survey found that 1% met lifetime prevalence criteria for bipolar I, 1.1% for bipolar II, and 2.4% for subthreshold symptoms.||[182] A more recent analysis of data from a second US National Comorbidity Survey found that 1% met lifetime prevalence criteria for bipolar I, 1.1% for bipolar II, and 2.4% for subthreshold symptoms.||[182] A more recent analysis of data from a second US National Comorbidity Survey found that 1% met lifetime prevalence criteria for bipolar I, 1.1% for bipolar II, and 2.4% for subthreshold symptoms.||[182] A more recent analysis of data from a second US National Comorbidity Survey found that 1% met lifetime prevalence criteria for bipolar I, 1.1% for bipolar II, and 2.4% for subthreshold symptoms.||[182] A more recent analysis of data from a second US National Comorbidity Survey found that 1% met lifetime prevalence criteria for bipolar I, 1.1% for bipolar II, and 2.4% for subthreshold symptoms.||[104]

You might cut your risk of acute kidney injury by taking care of your kidneys.||Sometimes, acute kidney injury causes lifelong loss of the use of the kidneys, called end-stage renal disease.||Acute kidney injury used to be called acute kidney failure.||Kidney disease, diabetes or high blood pressure increases your risk of acute kidney injury.||Acute kidney injury.||Acute kidney injury.||What is chronic venous insufficiency?||What causes chronic venous insufficiency?||What is chronic venous insufficiency?||What causes chronic venous insufficiency?||Prolonged venous hypertension causes tissue edema, inflammation, and hypoxia, leading to symptoms.||If you are a Mayo Clinic patient, this could include protected health information.||Compression is recommended for treatment and prevention of the effects of chronic venous insufficiency (ie, edema, venous ulcers) and is indicated for all patients.||Slowed blood flow to the kidneys

Conditions that may slow blood flow to the kidneys and lead to kidney injury include:

Loss of too much body fluid, called dehydration.||Clinical Overview: Acute kidney injury.||In general, unless the lower extremities are adequately cared for, patients with any manifestation of chronic venous insufficiency or post-thrombotic syndrome are at risk of progression to more advanced forms.||These can lead to acute kidney injury.||Table

Clinical Classification of Chronic Venous Insufficiency

Table

Venous stasis dermatitis consists of erythema, hyperpigmentation, induration, venous ectasia, lipodermatosclerosis (fibrosing subcutaneous panniculitis), lichenification, and venous stasis ulcers.||Chronic venous insufficiency occurs when venous obstruction (eg, in DVT), venous valvular insufficiency, or decreased contraction of muscles surrounding the veins (eg, due to immobility) decrease forward venous flow and increase venous pressure (venous hypertension).||Although the data are mixed as to whether compression stockings prevent post-thrombotic syndrome, they are useful to reduce symptoms of swelling, pain, and tightness that may occur after deep vein thrombosis (1).||Acute kidney injury ranges from mild to severe.||Post-thrombotic syndrome is symptomatic chronic venous insufficiency that follows DVT.||Acute kidney injury can cause the kidneys to stop working.||Elevation

Compression using bandages, stockings, and/or pneumatic devices

Topical treatments

Treatment of secondary infection, when present

Some experts believe that weight loss, regular exercise, and reduction of dietary sodium may benefit patients with bilateral chronic venous insufficiency.||Damage to the kidneys

The following may damage the kidneys and lead to acute kidney injury:

Swelling and irritation, called inflammation, of the tiny filters in the kidneys.||Risk factors for post-thrombotic syndrome in patients with DVT include proximal thrombosis, recurrent ipsilateral DVT, and body mass index (BMI) ≥ 22 kg/m2.||Sorry something went wrong with your subscription

Causes

Acute kidney injury can happen when:

You have a condition that slows blood flow to your kidneys.||Risk factors

Acute kidney injury almost always is linked to another medical condition or event.||Topical wound care is important in venous stasis ulcer management

Medications have no role in routine treatment of chronic venous insufficiency, although many patients are given aspirin, topical corticosteroids, diuretics for edema, or antibiotics.||Acute kidney injury happens when the kidneys suddenly can't filter waste products from the blood.||Stockings that provide 20 to 30 mm Hg of distal circumferential pressure are indicated for smaller varicose veins and mild chronic venous insufficiency; 30 to 40 mm Hg is indicated for larger varicose veins and moderate to severe disease.||Chronic venous insufficiency occurs when your leg veins don’t allow blood to flow back up to your heart.||Chronic venous insufficiency occurs when your leg veins don’t allow blood to flow back up to your heart.||Signs occur along a continuum: no changes to varicose veins (rare) to edema to stasis dermatitis on the lower legs and at the ankles, with or without ulceration (see table Clinical Classification of Chronic Venous Insufficiency).||A buildup of fluid in your lungs can cause shortness of breath.||Loss of appetite.||Taking too much of these medicines may increase your risk of kidney injury.||Elsevier Point of Care.

Botulinum toxin, or botulinum neurotoxin (commonly called botox), is a highly potent neurotoxic protein produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum and related species.||Botulinum toxin, a polypeptide produced by the Clostridium botulinum bacteria, is an acetylcholine release inhibitor in the peripheral nerve endings of the motor plate and sweat glands.||Botulinum toxin B is sold under the brand name Myobloc.||[84]

Role in disease

[edit]

Main article: Botulism

Botulinum toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum (an anaerobic, gram-positive bacterium) is the cause of botulism.||[137] Lanzhou Institute of Biological Products in China manufactures a botulinum toxin type-A product; as of 2014, it was the only botulinum toxin type-A approved in China.||Botulism is caused by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, a hardy anaerobe.||Botulism is caused by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, a hardy anaerobe.||[47] Botulinum toxin appears to be effective for refractory overactive bladder.||[35]

Botulinum toxins are among the most potent toxins known to science.||[86]

Two preparations of botulinum antitoxins are available for treatment of botulism.||[119] In 2019 the botulinum toxin market made US$3.19 billion.||Injection of botulinum toxin type-A into salivary glands is useful in reducing the secretions.||Botulinum toxin, a potent neurotoxic protein produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, has been used as treatment for a variety of medical indications for more than 25 years (Box, (1-12) page 10).||[141] Complicating the problem is that the taxonomy for C. botulinum remains chaotic.||Botulinum toxin type B received FDA approval for treatment of cervical dystonia in December 2000.||"Overview of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection: A Novel Formulation of Botulinum Toxin Type A".||Summary: This report analyzes the current and future scenario of the global Botulinum Toxin Market.||[129]

During the early 1980s, German and French newspapers reported that the police had raided a Baader-Meinhof gang safe house in Paris and had found a makeshift laboratory that contained flasks full of Clostridium botulinum, which makes botulinum toxin.||[56] Botulinum toxins have been used off-label for several pediatric conditions, including infantile esotropia.||[1]

Besides the three primary US manufacturers, numerous other botulinum toxin producers are known.||[137] Botulinum toxin type-A is also sold as Lantox and Prosigne on the global market.||[154] Well before this, the cosmetic use of botulinum toxin type A became widespread.||[27][28] Botulinum toxin is an acetylcholine release inhibitor and a neuromuscular blocking agent.||[87] With proper treatment, the case fatality rate for botulinum poisoning can be greatly reduced.||[24] Botulinum neurotoxins recognize distinct classes of receptors simultaneously (gangliosides, synaptotagmin and SV2).||A. Carruthers also studied and reported in 1992 the use of botulinum toxin type-A as a cosmetic treatment.||Brand names for botulinum toxin type-B include Myobloc in the United States and Neurobloc in the European Union.||[128] To confirm a diagnosis of botulinum toxin poisoning, therapeutically or to provide evidence in death investigations, botulinum toxin may be quantitated by immunoassay of human biological fluids; serum levels of 12–24 mouse LD50 units per milliliter have been detected in poisoned people.||From Washington Post

In fact Botulinum Toxin is a lethal substance that can cause botulism, a life-threatening illness.||Trivalent (serotypes A, B, E) botulinum antitoxin is derived from equine sources using whole antibodies.||[118]

US market

[edit]

In 2020, 4,401,536 botulinum toxin Type A procedures were administered.||From Washington Post

In fact Botulinum Toxin is a lethal substance that can cause botulism, a life-threatening illness.||Clark was aware that Botulinum toxin was safely being used to treat babies with strabismus and he requested and was granted FDA approval to experiment with Botulinum toxin to paralyze the moving and wrinkling normal functioning right forehead muscles to make both sides of the forehead appear the same.||Clark was aware that botulinum toxin was safely being used to treat babies with strabismus and he requested and was granted FDA approval to experiment with botulinum toxin to paralyze the moving and wrinkling normal functioning right forehead muscles to make both sides of the forehead appear the same.||[43] In addition to these uses, botulinum toxin is being evaluated for use in treating chronic pain.||[26] Humans most commonly ingest the toxin from eating improperly canned foods in which C. botulinum has grown.||Alastair Carruthers reported that others at the time also noticed these effects and discussed the cosmetic potential of botulinum toxin.||[124]

Bioterrorism

[edit]

Botulinum toxin has been recognized as a potential agent for use in bioterrorism.||[138] Neuronox, a botulinum toxin type-A product, was introduced by Medy-Tox of South Korea in 2009.||[59] However, the use of botulinum toxin injections for episodic migraine has not been approved by the FDA.||[135][63]

Botulinum toxin A is sold under the brand names Jeuveau, Botox, and Xeomin.||[112] Unlike other investigators, the Carruthers did more than just talk about the possibility of using botulinum toxin cosmetically.||[53][54] AbobotulinumtoxinA is the first and only FDA-approved botulinum toxin for the treatment of pediatric lower limb spasticity.||[70] The use of botulinum toxin A in children with cerebral palsy is safe in the upper and lower limb muscles.||[31]

Botulinum toxins are AB toxins and closely related to Anthrax toxin, Diphtheria toxin, and in particular tetanus toxin.||[69] Studies show that botulinum toxin may be injected into arthritic shoulder joints to reduce chronic pain and improve range of motion.||[147]

The botulinum toxin is denatured and thus deactivated at temperatures greater than 85 °C (185 °F) for five minutes.

How long do faculty members typically teach at this school?||The following are crucial skills that students gain from completing a physical therapy doctorate:

Theoretical Understanding

Physical therapy is an academically rigorous field, requiring practitioners to understand the complex systems of the human body, how they work, and how they can be rejuvenated after an injury.||How to Apply for PhD Programs in Physical Therapy

As you can see, choosing what type of doctorate degree in physical therapy you want to pursue can be a significant challenge.||That is a long way to come in ten years.||Keeping up with all the new research requires long study, such as a doctoral degree program in physical therapy.||How many students have gone through this program?||How has this degree improved the careers of its graduates?||How to Become a Physical Therapist About this section

Physical therapists entering the occupation need a Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) degree.||Alternative Doctorate Degrees in Physical Therapy

The median salary for a physical therapist is $97,720.||Doctorate degrees in physical therapy vary both in content and quality.||Students learn how to critically evaluate industry research and make assessments about its validity and practical application.||Resources for Researching Doctorate Degrees in Physical Therapy

By now it should be obvious that deciding to pursue a doctorate degree in physical therapy, and then choosing and applying to particular degree programs, is not simple.||Clinical experience

It's imperative for physical therapists to actually experience how evidence-based theories can be applied to the real world.||Clinical decision-making

The decisions made by physical therapists greatly impact how well a patient recovers from an accident or injury.||As a result, many classes allow students to observe how patients are treated in a clinical setting and get hands-on experience.||Professional doctorate degree

Now that the need for PhD programs in physical therapy has been established, it’s time to move on to the pressing matter of which PhD in physical therapy is right for you.||When evaluating doctorate degree programs in physical therapy, always consider:

Accreditation

Due to the relative newness of doctorate-level physical therapy degree programs, industry-specific accreditation for a DPT or PhD degree program is rare.||Students in Ph.D. programs gain extensive knowledge on the physical and emotional effects of injuries and how such factors influence treatment in order to develop the most effective recovery plan for each individual patient.||The pursuit of a professional specialty designation is a primary motivation for many students who strive for alternative doctorate degrees in physical therapy such as the DPTSc.||Luckily, choosing between schools is a bit simpler, if only because there are a limited number of schools that currently offer doctorate degrees in physical therapy.||For instance, students learn how to perform the duties of a physical therapist, while also taking science classes--such as biology and physiology--which educate them about the workings of the human body.||Quality of Faculty

The quality of a school’s faculty can be difficult to measure, but measure it you must before choosing a DPT or alternative doctorate degree program in physical therapy.||Program History and Performance

Similar to the accreditation dilemma, it can be difficult to measure the program history and performance of doctorate degree programs in physical therapy because the trend towards doctorate-level study in physical therapy is so new relative to other campus-based and online PhD programs.||These alternative doctorate degree programs include:

Doctor of Science (ScD or DSc)

The base pay of insurance executives, hospital executives and even hospital administrators often far outstrips doctors’ salaries, according to an analysis performed for The New York Times by Compdata Surveys: $584,000 on average for an insurance chief executive officer, $386,000 for a hospital C.E.O.||So, which specialties are demanding the highest pay rates these days?||They also differ from medical assistants, who do routine clinical and clerical tasks but do not practice medicine.||American doctors’ salaries are high for several reasons.||salaries.||To qualify for a license, candidates must graduate from an accredited medical school and complete residency training in their specialty.||Physicians spend years training, developing specialized skills that demand the higher pay rate.||What Physicians and Surgeons Do About this section

Physicians and surgeons diagnose and treat injuries or illnesses and address health maintenance.||Already a subscriber?||That’s a drop in the ocean compared with overhead for insurance companies, billing expenses for doctors’ offices, and advertising for drug companies.||What Is a Residency?||What Is a Fellow?||What Is an Intensivist?||Board certification in a specialty is not required for physicians and surgeons; however, it may increase their employment opportunities.||Want all of The Times?||In addition to this, dermatoligists also perform many aesthetic procedures that are paid for out of pocket rather than by insurance.||Physicians and surgeons must treat patients and their families with understanding.||Some physicians choose to work in fields that do not involve patient care, such as medical research or public policy.||Once their residency is complete, some continue their training with a fellowship for a subspecialty.||President Obama has promised to pay for health care reform mostly by ridding the system of wasteful spending.||Physician assistants differ from nurse practitioners in their training and the level of care they provide; for example, nurse practitioners cannot provide surgical care, whereas physician assistants can.||From there, they need to attend fellowship training for gastroenterology.||Duties

Physicians and surgeons typically do the following:

Take a patient’s medical history and perform a physical exam

Document and update charts and patient information to show findings and treatments

Order tests and consultations for other physicians or healthcare staff to perform

Review test results to identify abnormal findings

Recommend, design, and implement a treatment plan

Address concerns or answer questions that patients have about their health and well-being

Help patients take care of their health by discussing topics such as proper nutrition and hygiene

Physicians and surgeons focus on a particular type of practice.||In the same way many Americans complain about low teacher salaries, chatter about low doctors’ salaries is common in France, Japan, and the United Kingdom.||Medscape collected the salary data across more than 19,000 physicians across 26 specialties in the U.S. in order to analyze current pay trends and doctor satisfaction.||But what if your paycheck is part of the fat?||They also provide pain relief for patients in intensive care, for women in labor, and for patients suffering from chronic pain.||Physicians and surgeons need to convey information effectively to their patients and to other healthcare workers.||After all, it is possible to pay doctors too little.||Physicians and surgeons may spend many hours on their feet, including walking between patient visits or procedures.||Dermatology is a very competitive field for physicians.||Moreover, Americans don’t seem to mind paying doctors a lot—especially if insurance companies are the ones paying.||After all that, it’s no wonder doctors feel entitled to six-figure salaries.||Physician Supply and Demand

A 2020 report from the American Association of Medical Colleges projects a shortfall of up to 55,200 primary care physicians and up to 86,700 specialty physicians by 2033.||Nearly 34% said that gratitude from patients is the most reward part of their job, while another 32% said it was finding answers to tough diagnoses.||During their second phase of medical school, students work with patients under the supervision of experienced physicians in hospitals and clinics.||That said, it appears that health care reform will have some leveling effect on doctors’ salaries.||PAs, who can provide many of the same services as physicians, are expected to continue to expand their role in providing healthcare services.||That higher pay rate doesn’t always correspond to the hours and years of training required.||In addition to medical school and residency, these doctors also do a fellowship in critical care medicine.||To ensure that patients receive appropriate treatment, including medication, physicians and surgeons must be precise in monitoring them and recording information related to their care.||More to the point: Does cutting back on wasteful health care spending mean that doctors will make less money?||Their patients are mostly adults.||Like other physicians, neurologists must attend medical school then a residency for neurology.||A list of accredited physician assistant programs is available from the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant, Inc. (ARC-PA).||“It will come from savings within the system.”

Beyond that, however, it’s hard for the government to set physician income.||From there, they may pursue fellowship training for a subspecialty, such as pediatric neurology or vascular neurology (related to blood vessels in the brain).||These physicians evaluate, care for, and stabilize patients whose illness or injury requires immediate attention.||At least 64% of doctors polled said they would choose medicine as a career if they had to do it all over.||From there, they may choose to attend fellowship training for a subspecialty of radiology that is focused on a specific aspect of radiology or area of the body.

What Is Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome?||How Do You Treat Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome?||Symptoms Of Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome

Spotting CHS in regular users of cannabis is easy if you know what to watch for.||Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome was first documented in Australia in 2004.||Phases Of Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome

Once someone develops CHS, it runs a course of three phases.||She had an obscure syndrome called cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, a condition only recently acknowledged by the medical community.||The Rise Of Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome

Cannabis or marijuana is the most commonly misused illicit drug in America.||Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome (CHS) is characterized by a cluster of symptoms like cyclic nausea and vomiting and compulsive hot water bathing, as well as abdominal pain with no particular identifiable cause.||What is cannabis hyperemesis syndrome?||Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is a condition that leads to repeated and severe bouts of vomiting.||Key points about cannabis hyperemesis syndrome

CHS is a condition that leads to repeated and severe bouts of vomiting.||This condition, called cannabinoid hyperemesis acute renal failure (CHARF), has been found to be secondary to CHS in some patients.||Recurrent nausea

Pain in the abdominal region that is often described as “colicky”

Cyclical vomiting

A compulsive urge to keep having hot water baths to ease other symptoms

Symptoms stop when you do not take any cannabis

Other symptoms noted in research include :

Anxiety and agitation

Sweating

Tachycardia or an abnormal heart rate

Postural hypotension, where blood pressure falls when you stand up from a lying/seated position

Continuous sipping of water due to polydipsia or excessive thirst

Mild fever

The Risk Of Renal Failure

Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome (CHS) left unchecked can leave you severely dehydrated and put you at risk of prerenal failure.||What are the symptoms of CHS?||Toxicologists say the chemical compounds in marijuana may throw off the normal function of the body’s cannabinoid receptors, which help regulate the nervous system.||But with the risk of renal failure in more advanced cases of the syndrome, it is important to act quickly.||Although there’s still no magic cure for a patient’s marijuana-related hyperemesis, Moulin and other doctors say they’re getting better at treating the symptoms, using old antipsychotic medications and cream for muscle aches.||The syndrome may take several years to develop.||Symptoms during this time may include:

Ongoing nausea

Repeated episodes of vomiting

Belly pain

Decreased food intake and weight loss

Symptoms of fluid loss (dehydration)

During this phase, vomiting is often intense and overwhelming.||The bulk of those with CHS – 95 percent – have been found to use cannabis on a daily basis for an average of 9.8 years before seeing the onset of the syndrome.||Once you know what you’re dealing with, getting rid of symptoms may simply involve stopping intake of cannabis.||You may not want to believe that marijuana may be the underlying cause of your symptoms.||Long-term marijuana use can change the way the affected molecules respond and lead to the symptoms of CHS.||If you or anyone you know shows any of these symptoms, it’s time to suspect CHS.||Also, resuming use of cannabis will, in all likelihood, cause all these symptoms to come right back.||However, feeling better after taking a hot shower is very suspicious for this syndrome.||During this time, symptoms go away.||Due to the overlap of some of these symptoms with other problems, it often goes undiagnosed or, more commonly, is misdiagnosed as something else.||Heard said he doesn’t believe cases of the pot syndrome increased after recreational use was legalized in 2012, because chronic users probably already had medical marijuana cards.||In between these episodes are times without any symptoms.||That is a health problem that causes similar symptoms.||Symptoms often come back if the person tries marijuana again.||Symptoms almost always come back if you use marijuana again.||It still isn’t clear why some heavy marijuana users get the syndrome, but others don't.||CHS is easily mistaken for other problems like an eating disorder, drug seeking behavior, or cyclic vomiting syndrome.||“I really like to make people feel better.”

Diagnosing the syndrome can also be frustrating — and expensive.||Most people self-treat using hot showers to help reduce their symptoms.||If you stop using marijuana, your symptoms should not come back.||If they don’t, their symptoms will likely come back.||In between these episodes you may not have any symptoms at all!||Recovery Phase

During recovery, your symptoms will start to go away.||Patients may need intravenous hydration and hospital stays until the symptoms subside.||The drug is also good at stopping such symptoms in people having chemotherapy.||Hyperemetic Phase

During hyperemetic episodes, symptoms become more obvious and occur cyclically.||Symptoms start to go away within a day or 2 after stopping marijuana use.||Toxicologists say the heat may distract the brain from pain receptors in the abdomen but, like the syndrome itself, that phenomenon is not well understood.||Some people may be genetically predisposed to the syndrome, or marijuana’s potency or chemical makeup may have changed over time, said Dr. Craig Smollin, medical director of the San Francisco division of the California Poison Control System, who also works as an emergency physician at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital.||During this phase, the main symptoms are often early morning nausea and belly (abdominal) pain.||To make a diagnosis, your healthcare provider will ask you about your symptoms and your past health.||Chalfonte LeNee Queen is still struggling to completely quit marijuana, but her symptoms are down to a dull stomachache.

===========================
However, can increasing the number of times you eat each day really speed up your metabolic rate and help with weight loss?||Many individuals eat every 2-3 hours.||Let's take a look at the common claims people make about meal frequency and the research behind those claims, with an eye toward figuring out how often you should really eat to most effectively achieve your goals!||Consume a number of meals that allows you to meet your nutritional needs consistently each day, and don't stress over needing to eat every 2-3 hours.||Meal Myth 3: More Meals Means More Muscle Growth

Many individuals consume more meals throughout the day in an attempt to build more muscle.||What we really need to look at is more long-term data to see if, over time, the number of meals you eat a day has a significant impact on muscle growth.||Meal Myth 2: Eating 5-6 Smaller Meals a Day Will Aid Weight Loss

You may have been told before that eating 5-6 mini meals a day will help you achieve your fat-loss goals faster.||Some eat only once per day or within a small window of time.||Find a meal frequency that allows you to be consistent with your nutrition plan, and you will be well on your way to reaching your fitness goals!||Focus on consuming fewer calories than you are expending for weight loss, rather than the number of meals you are consuming.||Meal Myth 1: Eating More Frequently Will Increase My Metabolism

Individuals who eat multiple meals throughout the day often cite an increase in metabolic rate as the reason for doing so.||One of the most widely debated topics in the bodybuilding and fitness world is the optimal number of meals to eat per day for building muscle, losing fat, and increasing strength.||(OK, it's not quite that simple, but you get the general point.)||Half of the participants consumed six meals a day, while the other half consumed two meals a day.||After two weeks, there was greater muscle retention with six meals a day.||This is supported in practice by individuals consuming a range of meal frequencies from one to more than eight meals a day who have been able to develop great physiques and achieve their fitness goals.||Researchers out of Nagoya University (Japan) recruited male boxers and had them consume 1,200 calories a day while dieting for a fight.||[2,3,5-7]

For individuals with a healthy body weight, no difference in weight change was observed when consuming one versus three and two versus nine meals per day.||[16]

It should be noted here that calorie intake was only 1,200 calories a day and protein intake was only 60 grams a day (roughly 0.45 grams per pound of body weight), both of which are far lower than most males who are dieting with the goal of muscle retention.||[11,12]

However, these studies have all been acute, meaning they gave subjects one protein-filled meal, tracked rates of protein synthesis for a few hours, and then called it a day.||Looking at studies lasting anywhere from 2-8 weeks, for both overweight individuals and individuals with a healthy BMI, it doesn't appear that the number of meals consumed per day has a significant impact on lean mass.||[7,8,13-15] Even for individuals who are dieting, eating six meals a day doesn't appear to be more beneficial than eating three meals when it comes to maintaining muscle mass.||[1-2] Furthermore, no difference in metabolic rate was seen between consuming 2 or 7 meals daily in participants of a healthy weight.||Total calories and macronutrient composition seem to play a greater role in fat loss and muscle growth.||The truth

Meal frequency doesn't seem to have a significant effect on muscle mass when dietary intake is constant; however, more research is needed in athletes who are lifting weights.||Based on studies looking at the rate of muscle protein synthesis—the rate at which protein is being made in the muscle, which means more muscle growth—following feeding, several researchers have suggested that a meal frequency of 3-5 meals daily, with protein intake evenly distributed, is optimal to maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis rates and therefore muscle growth.||Others do something in between.||Furthermore, no difference in weight loss between one versus five meals was observed in dieting participants of healthy bodyweight.||In other words, total calories consumed count more than frequency!||In other words, there is no one best meal frequency.||This sounds great in theory—eat more frequently, and still lose weight!||A Final Word on Frequency

Based on the current research, meal frequency doesn't seem to be as important as once thought for speeding up metabolic rate, aiding fat loss, or increasing muscle growth.||When consuming the same total calories split between two versus six meals, one versus three versus five meals, or two versus 3-5 meals, there was no difference in metabolic rate in overweight or obese individuals.||However, it should be noted that the previously mentioned studies were not done in athletes who regularly lift weights.||To date, only one study has investigated the effects of meal frequency and muscle mass in physically active individuals.||Therefore, these results need to be interpreted with caution, and further research is needed on meal frequency in athletes.||The majority of the studies investigating the effects of meal frequency on weight loss have been performed in overweight and obese populations.||Focus on consuming adequate calorie and protein intake (around 30 grams of protein per meal) while increasing strength in the gym to maximize muscle growth.||When daily calorie intake was matched, no difference in weight loss between one versus nine meals, three versus six meals, one versus three versus five meals, two versus 3-5 meals, or three versus six meals has been observed.||Is there an ideal meal frequency to optimize fat loss, muscle growth, and metabolism?||Several studies have investigated this question, and the results are fairly conclusive.||[4]

The truth

Increasing meal frequency does not increase metabolic rate when dietary intake is matched.||However, findings from studies looking at this topic aren't so positive.||[8-10]

The truth

Meal frequency doesn't appear to have an effect on weight maintenance or weight loss when calorie intake is matched.||Based on these studies, it doesn't appear that meal frequency has an effect on muscle mass.||References

Although several early maps, such as the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, have illustrations of mythological creatures for decoration, the phrase itself is an anachronism.
===========================
There are two daily trains to Miami, one daily train to Charlotte, and one daily train to Savannah.||[38][39][40][41][42] Life in New York City is so dependent on the subway that the city is home to one of the few 24-hour subway systems in the world.||If you want to know how much your trip will cost, ask the driver before the trip starts.||For trips beyond the airport, the train costs $8.25.||They include train stations, bus terminals, and ferry landings.||It’s often cheaper to buy train tickets in advance.||More than 500 people annually work as bicycle rickshaw, or pedicab, drivers, who in 2005 handled one million passengers.||During one day in September 2005, 7.5 million daily riders set a record for ridership.||Japan

Mass transit use and car ownership

[edit]

New York City is distinguished from other U.S. cities for its low personal automobile ownership and its significant use of public transportation.||Amtrak accounts for 47% of all non-automobile intercity trips between New York City and Washington, D.C. and about 14% of all intercity trips (including those by automobile) between those cities.||You can find out more and buy tickets from Via Rail Canada or going to a train station in person.||There are also international daily trains to Toronto and Montreal in Canada, via the Empire Corridor to Albany and points west.||Public transportation (public transit)

All cities and most major towns in Canada have a public transportation system with one or more ways to travel, such as:

bus

train

subway

light-rail trains

streetcars (trams)

If you plan to use public transportation, research your options before you decide where to live.||These rail systems converge at the two busiest train stations in the United States, Penn Station and Grand Central Terminal, both in Manhattan.||[9]

Commuting

[edit]

Of all people who commuted to work in New York City in 2021, 32% use the subway, 30% drive alone, 12% take the bus, 10% walk to work, 4% travel by commuter rail, 5.6% carpool, 3.1% use a taxi, 1.7% ride their bicycle to work, and 0.4% travel by ferry.||In 2009, an estimated 200,000 city residents bicycle on a typical day,[95] and make 655,000 trips each day, greater than the number of the ten most popular bus routes in the city.||Chicago is connected with New York City by two trains: one runs daily via Upstate New York and Cleveland, while another runs three times a week on a longer route via Cincinnati.||In 1904, the first subway line became operational.||[23]

In 2013, ridership on the New York City Subway was 1.7 billion,[24] the highest ridership since 1946, despite Hurricane Sandy-related subway closures.||[31][32] Average weekday subway ridership was 5.076 million in September 2006, while combined subway and bus ridership on an average weekday that month was 7.61 million.||Private bus companies Hampton Jitney and Hampton Luxury Liner operate daily, year-round service from points on the east side of Manhattan to the villages and hamlets of Long Island's east end, including the Hamptons, Montauk, and the North Fork.||In 2002, an average 4.8 million passengers used the subway each weekday.||Like the New York City Subway, PATH operates 24 hours a day.||[55] BestBus provides daily service from a stop along West 34th Street near 9th Avenue to Washington, D.C., Silver Spring, Maryland, and Manassas, Vienna, and Springfield in Virginia and summer weekend service to Rehoboth Beach and Dewey Beach in Delaware.||Ridership consistently increased in the early 21st century, partly because of the subway's energy efficiency.||Buses

[edit]

Further information: MTA Regional Bus Operations

As of 2014 , over 5,710 MTA Regional Bus Operations-operated buses carried about 2.5 million daily passengers 24/7 on more than 238 local routes, 62 express routes, and 7 Select Bus Service routes, amounting to 793 million annual bus trips.||[36] It is the second-oldest subway system in the United States after the rapid transit system in Boston.||The subway is a popular location for politicians to meet voters during elections and is also a major venue for musicians.||However, when the subway finally connected to Roosevelt Island in 1989, the tram was too popular to discontinue use.||The service began in late 2012 in the wake of massive subway infrastructure damage and service disruptions in Queens and Brooklyn from Hurricane Sandy, and was originally intended only as a temporary transportation alternative until subway service was restored, but it proved to be popular and was extended several times after that.||Travel time from Roosevelt Island to Manhattan is just under five minutes and the fare is the same as a subway ride.||System rollout of OMNY to all buses and subway stations was complete in 2020, and OMNY will replace the MetroCard by 2023.||[33]

Rapid transit systems

[edit]

MTA

[edit]

The New York City Subway is the largest subway system in the world when measured by number of stations (472),[34] and the eighth-largest[35] when measured by annual ridership (1.76 billion passenger trips in 2015).||Dollar vans in the New York metropolitan area serve major areas in Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx that lack adequate subway service.||[43] The city's 28 subway services run through all boroughs except Staten Island, which is served 24/7 by the Staten Island Railway.||Much of the city, excluding Staten Island, relies on the subway, which is open 24 hours a day, as its main source of transportation.||Campaigning at subway stations is a staple of New York elections akin to candidate appearances at small town diners during presidential campaigns in the rest of the country.||Major rail stations include:

Pennsylvania Station, which is served by Amtrak, Long Island Rail Road, New Jersey Transit, and the New York City Subway

Grand Central Terminal, which is served by Metro-North Railroad, Long Island Rail Road and the New York City Subway

Jamaica station, which is served by Long Island Rail Road, New York City Subway, and AirTrain JFK

Atlantic Terminal, which is served by the New York City Subway and Long Island Rail Road

Newark Pennsylvania Station, which is served by Amtrak, New Jersey Transit, PATH and Newark Light Rail

Hoboken Terminal, which is served by New Jersey Transit, Metro-North Railroad, PATH, Hudson-Bergen Light Rail, and NY Waterway

Major bus hubs include:

Port Authority Bus Terminal, served by commuter and intercity buses.||Subway riders pay with the MetroCard, which is also valid on all other rapid transit systems and buses in the city, as well as the Roosevelt Island tramway.||AirTrain JFK is an 8.1 mi (13 km) rapid transit system that connects Kennedy to New York's subway and commuter rail network in Queens 24 hours a day.||Once the city government proposed the 7 Subway Extension/IRT Flushing Line (7 and <7>​ trains), it lost interest in any light rail on 42nd Street.||If you’re travelling to a place without an airport you’ll need to:

fly to the nearest main airport

rent a car or take a train or bus to your final stop

To fly in Canada, you need:

a piece of photo identification issued by the federal, provincial or territorial government in Canada, or

a foreign passport

Rail

The transportation system of New York City is a network of complex infrastructural systems.||Three characteristics of the city environment—living in areas with mixed residential and commercial uses, living near bus and subway stops and living in population-dense areas—were found to be inversely associated with BMI levels.||[44]

While some PATH stations are adjacent to subway stations in New York City, Newark, and the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail stations in Hudson County, there are no free transfers.||In 2013, the subway delivered over 1.71 billion rides,[37] averaging approximately 5.5 million rides on weekdays, about 3.2 million rides on Saturdays, and about 2.6 million rides on Sundays.||Since many LIRR commuters work on the east side of Manhattan, many in walking distance of Grand Central, this project saves travel time and reduces congestion at Penn Station and on subway routes connecting it with the east side.||Some proposals will compete with others for available funding:

The Second Avenue Subway, a north–south line first proposed in 1919,[130] will run from 125th Street in East Harlem to Hanover Square in Lower Manhattan when completed.

[edit]

The evidence on differences in estimation accuracy of different estimation approaches and models suggest that there is no "best approach" and that the relative accuracy of one approach or model in comparison to another depends strongly on the context .||The estimation approaches based on functionality-based size measures, e.g., function points, is also based on research conducted in the 1970s and 1980s, but are re-calibrated with modified size measures and different counting approaches, such as the use case points[11] or object points and COSMIC Function Points in the 1990s.||Test Estimation Process

The day of the dead is a celebration in honour of loved ones who have passed on.||Sugar skull

The other common design of these tattoos is the sugar skulls.||The same happened to the traditional day of the dead tattoo, they were all quite similar but as more artists did them, they included a touch of their own style.||Traditional

Traditionally, day of the dead tattoos, murals, paintings and portraits were made in the representation of the goddess ‘Lady of the Dead’.||To serve as a reminder of the dead, people get tattoos in the form of a skull to remember someone, hence they became known as day of the dead tattoos.||Day of the Dead motifs have their own color code-pink for joy-red for blood, life, and sacrifice-purple/indigo for grief and mourning-white for home and purity of spirit-and orange for the dawn of a new day.||Day of the Dead motifs have their own color code-pink for joy-red for blood, life, and sacrifice-purple/indigo for grief and mourning-white for home and purity of spirit-and orange for the dawn of a new day.||And as more people 'get it', these Day of the Dead symbols find their way onto more living bodies as tattoos.||And as more people 'get it', these Day of the Dead symbols find their way onto more living bodies as tattoos.||Although skulls in most parts of the world represent danger, the South and Central American communities see it as a sign of a rebirth after death, but also to remind us that death is inevitable.||Due to its time being close to Halloween, The "Day of the Dead" is commonly thought to be similar to Halloween, although the two holidays actually have little in common.||Due to its time being close to Halloween, The "Day of the Dead" is commonly thought to be similar to Halloween, although the two holidays actually have little in common.||This spiralled into various types of the same tattoo.||The memorial tattoo might go so far as a portrait of the deceased-but likely in the form of a skeleton.||The memorial tattoo might go so far as a portrait of the deceased-but likely in the form of a skeleton.||Half sugar skull, half self-portrait and all the decorations of a traditional tattoo.||The "Day of the Dead" is a time of celebration, where partying is very common, although this is not very well understood in the U.S. because they celebrate Halloween as a "scary" holiday, where people will put up scary decorations and have children knock on doors for candy.||The "Day of the Dead" is a time of celebration, where partying is very common, although this is not very well understood in the U.S. because they celebrate Halloween as a "scary" holiday, where people will put up scary decorations and have children knock on doors for candy.||The artist will turn it into a stencil and use it to make the tattoo in the actual image of the person.||It is just a skull, really, hollow and empty, to really show acceptance of the dead.||The last thing you want is a tattoo of your mom with a sideways nose or something, which would be disastrous.||How about a full-body tattoo?||Because of this reverence to the dead, they usually host a celebration, Dia de los Muertos, annually to remember the deceased.||back to menu ↑

Meaning

The meaning of each tattoo varies with colour, which is why so much emphasis is placed on that.||As such, the tattoo ends up being quite large to show all these details.||Hybrids

Feeling adventurous, why not mix it up, combine aspects of all other types into one, awesome tattoo.||In fact, during the celebration, people sing and dance to honour loved ones, weird we know, but few tears are shed on the day.||Latinos would probably stick to the folk art style, but the dead aren't going to object to a cartoon-style skeleton, or the Sailor Jerry look.||Latinos would probably stick to the folk art style, but the dead aren't going to object to a cartoon-style skeleton, or the Sailor Jerry look.||Combine a self-portrait with a sugar skull and you have yourself a never before seen tattoo.||I know that may sound a bit scary but it really makes your tattoo stand out, and it will represent everyone you have ever lost, instead of just one.||Again, make sure your tattoo artist is capable of pulling it off, you don’t want your skin to become their sketchpad for experiments, especially considering how large these tattoos are.||They simply represent their dead, and serve as a reminder to those who have passed away.||Pink: represents joy and celebration, maybe you’re glad someone is gone like an abusive spouse or an enemy

Purple or indigo: shows grief, it reminds you of the pain of losing a loved one

White: this colour is common among family members to show hope and purity of a spirit gone

Orange: this is the colour of the rising sun and indicates hope, that you will make it through despite the pain of loss

It is also possible to use multiple colours in your tattoo, provided they represent how you feel.||It’s an awesome tattoo guaranteed to turn heads and if done well, you will want it to be visible, so put it somewhere like the upper arm or thigh.||All traditional styles of these tattoos are very detailed, a lot of colour is included and the main image of the goddess is clearly defined.||Get a picture of the deceased and take it to the artist.||The rest of the body can be dressed or smaller than the skull to emphasize on the skull.||People go to cemeteries to communicate with the souls of the departed, and build private altars, containing the favorite foods and beverages, as well as photos and memorabilia, of the departed.||People go to cemeteries to communicate with the souls of the departed, and build private altars, containing the favorite foods and beverages, as well as photos and memorabilia, of the departed.||Although most of the time these tattoos are mainly one colour or the other.||Traditional tattoos are therefore all sort of similar because the face is always the same.

In the 1980s, first genital herpes and then AIDS emerged into the public consciousness as sexually transmitted infections that could not be cured by modern medicine.||STDs are sometimes referred to as sexually transmitted infections since these conditions involve the transmission of an infectious organism between sex partners.||[7][8] The term sexually transmitted infection is generally preferred over sexually transmitted disease or venereal disease, as it includes cases with no symptomatic disease.||Both may be transmitted via contact with blood; for hepatitis B, sexual transmission is believed to be responsible for 30% of the cases worldwide.||"Sexually Transmitted Infections Treatment Guidelines, 2021" (PDF).||Blood, urine, vaginal or anal swab, and saliva are the most common specimens used for STD tests.||Blood, urine, vaginal or anal swab, and saliva are the most common specimens used for STD tests.||The transfer of and exposure to bodily fluids, such as blood transfusions and other blood products, sharing injection needles, needle-stick injuries (when medical staff are inadvertently jabbed or pricked with needles during medical procedures), sharing tattoo needles, and childbirth are other avenues of transmission.||However, people that share unsterilized needles markedly increase the chance to pass many diseases, including STDs (especially hepatitis B), to others.||Symptoms of STDs caused by parasites

What Are the Types and Causes of Sexually Transmitted Diseases?||[citation needed]

It is possible to be an asymptomatic carrier of sexually transmitted infections.||In particular, sexually transmitted infections in women often cause the serious condition of pelvic inflammatory disease.||There are also two vaccines available for women (Cervarix and Gardasil) that protect against the types of HPV that cause cervical cancer.||Some STIs pass from one person to another through infected blood.||The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the more inclusive term sexually transmitted infection since 1999.||"Venereal Diseases" .||[103] In the United States there were 19 million new cases of sexually transmitted infections in 2010.||[122]

The first effective treatment for a sexually transmitted infection was salvarsan, a treatment for syphilis.||[112] Hepatitis B is also considered a sexually transmitted infection because it can be spread through sexual contact.||Contact tracing continues to be an important measure, even when diseases are incurable, as it helps to contain infection.||With the discovery of antibiotics, a large number of sexually transmitted infections became easily curable, and this, combined with effective public health campaigns against STIs, led to a public perception during the 1960s and 1970s that they have ceased to be a serious medical threat.||[104]

In 2010, 19 million new cases of sexually transmitted infections occurred in women in the United States.||Many states require that Child Protective Services be notified if children are diagnosed with an STD.||The CDC recommends that sexually active women under the age of 25 and those over 25 at risk should be screened for chlamydia and gonorrhea yearly.||See also

A sexually transmitted infection (STI), also referred to as a sexually transmitted disease (STD) and the older term venereal disease (VD), is an infection that is spread by sexual activity, especially vaginal intercourse, anal sex, oral sex, or sometimes manual sex.||Some diseases are not considered to be officially an STD (for example, hepatitis types A, C, E) but are infrequently noted to be transferred during sexual activity.||Symptoms are abscesses (buboes) in the groin, rectum, or other areas; fistulas that drain pus may occur and are treatable with antibiotics.

Signs and complications

[edit]

The symptoms of CVID vary between those affected.||This treatment alone is not wholly effective, and many people still experience other symptoms such as lung disease and noninfectious inflammatory symptoms.||However, symptoms vary greatly between people.||About 20% of people with CVID, however, have symptoms of the disease or are found to be immunodeficient in childhood.||Due to the late onset of symptoms, other names that have been used in the past for CVID include:

Acquired agammaglobulinemia/hypogammaglobulinemia.||Anxiety and depression can occur as a result of dealing with the other symptoms.||Symptoms of joint inflammation may disappear with adequate Ig replacement therapy and appropriate antibiotics.||We ask about general symptoms (anxious mood, depressed mood, fatigue, pain, and stress) regardless of condition.||In the absence of a significant T lymphocyte defect or organ damage, Ig replacement therapy almost always brings improvement in symptoms.||Monitoring for autoimmunity is usually accomplished through routine blood counts and general medical oversight, which will reveal characteristic symptoms.||[16] A mutation in the NFKB2 gene has recently been shown to cause CVID-like symptoms in a murine model.||Top 5 symptoms reported by people with hypogammaglobulinemia*

*Reports may be affected by other conditions and/or medication side effects.||[2] Symptoms generally include high susceptibility to pathogens, chronic lung disease, as well as inflammation and infection of the gastrointestinal tract.||In some people with digestive problems, the detection and eradication of infections due to bacteria, parasites, or viruses may help eliminate the GI symptoms.||Those with GI symptoms and malabsorption should be evaluated for the presence of Giardia lamblia, rotavirus, Campylobacter, norovirus, bacterial overgrowth, and other GI infections.||Routine endoscopy is not required although people with suggestive GI symptoms should have appropriate upper and/or lower endoscopy (colonoscopy) with examination for H pylori, pathogenic bacteria or viruses, or other mucosal changes.||[19]

The examples of possible immune cell population changes in CVID [19] Population Change B cells Memory B (CD19+CD27+) decreased Plasma cells decreased Transitional B cells increased CD21low B cells increased T cells Naive CD4+ decreased Memory CD4+ increased Naive CD8+ decreased Memory CD8+ increased

Diagnosis

[edit]

According to a European registry study, the mean age at onset of symptoms was 26.3 years old.||Recent studies have suggested a role of gut microbiota in the etiology of CVID, and the reduction of mucosal IgA in CVID enteropathy.||[12]

Pathogenesis of CVID

[edit]

Genetic defects

[edit]

The causative factors of CVID are not fully known.||[11]

CVID patients generally complain of severe fatigue.||CVID is a lifelong disease.||Finding new ways to study CVID.||[9]

Enteropathy

[edit]

There is a wide spectrum of noninfectious gastrointestinal pathology and inflammation in CVID that is a part of the general immune dysregulation affecting patients with CVID.||Approximately 21% of people with CVID may have significant GI problems.||Diagnosis is difficult because of the diversity of phenotypes seen in people with CVID.||[8]

Malignancy and CVID

[edit]

The patients with CVID have a risk 5 to 12 times higher than the general population.||Epidemiology

[edit]

CVID has an estimated prevalence of about 1:50,000 in Caucasians.||Though many polymorphisms and mutations have been identified, their respective roles in CVID development are poorly understood and not represented in all people with CVID.||Treatment

The treatment of CVID is similar to that of other disorders with low levels of serum immunoglobulins.||Charles Janeway Sr. is generally credited with the first description of a case of CVID in 1953.||[13] CVID has since emerged as the predominant class of primary antibody deficiencies.||[2]

CVID affects males and females equally.||Clinical features

Both males and females may have CVID.||Notably, approximately 10% of people display CD4+ T cell counts lower than 200 cells/mm3; this particular phenotype of CVID has been named LOCID (Late Onset Combined Immunodeficiency) and has a poorer prognosis than classical CVID.||Sometimes, it is the presence of one of these other conditions that prompts an evaluation for CVID.||[5] Infections are also the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in CVID patients.||Gastrovascular infections or inflammation are very common for those with CVID.||[5]

Autoimmune disorders

[edit]

CVID is frequently associated with a variety of autoimmune diseases.||The frequency of this NFKB2 mutation in the CVID population is, however, yet to be established.||In general, people with CVID display higher frequencies of naive B cells and lower frequencies of class-switched memory B cells.||For example, serum immunoglobulin levels in people with CVID vary greatly.||People often experience adverse side effects from immunoglobulin infusions, including:

swelling at the insertion site (common in SCIG)

chills

headache

nausea (common in IVIG)

fatigue (common in IVIG)

muscle aches and pain, or joint pain

fever (common in IVIG and rare in SCIG)

hives (rare)

thrombotic events (rare)

aseptic meningitis (rare, more common in people with SLE)

anaphylactic shock (very rare)

In addition to Ig replacement therapy, treatment may also involve immune suppressants to control autoimmune symptoms of the disease and high-dose steroids like corticosteroids.||[8]

The reason for such a high prevalence of autoimmunity in CVID individuals is not fully understood.||Due to impaired antibody development, vaccination is not effective for CVID patients.||The reported prevalence of autoimmunity ranged from 14% to 54% in CVID patients and is higher for females.||The heterogenous group of patients makes it difficult to find common grounds for treatment for the GI inflammation in CVID.||CVID shortens the lifespan, but no study currently has a median age recorded.||Most individuals with CVID carry out most, if not all, normal activities.||Although CVID is often thought of as a serum immunoglobulin- and B cell-mediated disease, T cells can display abnormal behavior.||Finally, people with CVID may have an increased risk of cancer, especially cancer of the lymphoid system or possibly the gastrointestinal tract.

Question

I signed a contract to buy furniture and tried to cancel within 3 days.||Can’t I cancel a contract within 3 days?||To cancel a transaction, you must send the seller written notice within three full business days after the purchase date.||Answer

You can cancel some, but not very many, contracts within three days.||The federal Truth in Lending Act allows borrowers to cancel certain agreements that use their primary home as collateral within three business days without facing a financial penalty.||If you are 65 or over, and the contract is for home repair or remodeling, you have 15 full business days to cancel.||Consumers have a right to cancel door-to-door, home repair, or remodeling transactions within three business days after the purchase date when the total transaction is for $25 or more, and the sale is made when the seller is physically present in your residence.||If you do not make the items available to the seller or if you agree to return the items but fail to do so, then you remain obligated under the contract.||If the property isn't picked up within 20 days after you made it available, you are entitled to keep the property without any obligation to pay for it.||When you are solicited in your home, the seller must do the following:

Inform you orally and in writing of your right to cancel,

Provide the written notice of cancellation in the contract or on the receipt of purchase, and

Give you two copies of the notice, one copy for your records and one to send to the seller in the event of cancellation.||Within 20 days, the seller must either pick up the items left with you, or, if you agree to send back the items, reimburse you for mailing expenses.||It’s important to understand that this right to cancel does not apply to loans used to buy your house.||Under Illinois law, consumers are also protected with a three-day right to cancel for these types of transactions:

Campground Memberships (Illinois Campground Membership Act)

Physical Fitness Center Contracts (Illinois Physical Fitness Services Act)

The Federal Trade Commission’s “Cooling-Off Rule” gives you three days to cancel purchases of $25 or more that are made at your home or workplace (such as a door-to-door salesperson), or at a seller’s temporary location, such as hotel or motel rooms, convention centers, fairgrounds, or restaurants.||The seller must refund any deposit you made on the purchase within ten days of receiving your cancellation notice.||When it exists, the three-day right to cancel permits people with “buyer’s remorse” to get out of deals they regret.||Under Illinois law, consumers are protected with a three-day right to cancel certain types of transactions.||People often say yes just to make the salesman leave.||The article has been updated to include changes in the law and additional information.||The rule also does not apply to automobile auctions or arts and crafts fairs.||It does, however, apply to home equity loans and mortgage loan refinancing.||Depending on the seller's regular hours of operation, "business days" may include weekends.||Editor's note: This article was updated in October 2019 to include the new 15-day rule for people 65 and up, effective 8/9/19.||The following question was originally submitted to John Roska, a lawyer and writer for the weekly column "The Law Q&A" in the Champaign News Gazette.||If you think a seller has violated any of these laws or the FTC’s Cooling-Off Rule, report it to:

the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov

the Illinois Attorney General Consumer Protection Division.||For example, the rule does not cover sales that are made entirely by mail or telephone, are the result of prior negotiations made by you at the seller's permanent business location where the goods are regularly sold, or are needed to meet an emergency.||The store said I couldn’t.||The three-day “cooling off period” protects people in particularly vulnerable situations.||One of these is door-to-door sales.||Door-to-door sales are especially high-pressure situations.||Another example is home repair or remodeling contracts.||This is as long as the seller has a fixed place of business somewhere.||The rule includes some exceptions.||It also applies when you finance something besides your house using your house as collateral.||An example of that last type of transaction is a home repair loan.

How much are closing costs on a VA loan?||There is no limit on how much the seller can contribute toward these costs in a VA loan.||But there are limits on what charges can and cannot increase and by how much.||How do VA loan closing costs differ from other mortgages?||This is often misconstrued, misrepresented or outright mistaken, so let's state it as plainly as possible: There is no cap on how much a seller can contribute on VA loan closing costs.||The VA limits what borrowers can pay in closing costs, and there are actually some costs Veterans aren't allowed to pay.||Get Help from a Trusted Loan Specialist

Using a VA mortgage calculator is often insufficient to understand how much house you can afford and what the best borrowing option for you is.||Therefore, it is crucial to determine how much house you can afford, decide on a maximum home price, and make your monthly budget breakdown depending on your loan cost.||How to Prepare for Buying a Home with a VA Loan?||So, what exactly is included in “closing costs” for a VA loan?||How Do Seller Concessions Work?||Sellers are not required to offer concessions or pay any of a VA buyer's closing costs.||Let’s take a look at how the VA regulates closing costs for a VA loan:

The Origination Fee

The VA loan origination fee rule limits the amount a lender can charge for originating a VA loan to 1% of the loan amount.||In fact, the VA buyer will have no closing costs, no down payment, and in this case, a pesky $8,000 debt paid off at settlement.||Here are some general rules:

===========================
If symptoms are present or if there are other problems, surgery may be recommended for repair.||Thus, the beginning of the aorta is referred to as the ascending aorta , followed by the arch of the aorta, then the descending aorta .||Medical management (nonsurgical) is usually preferred for type B dissection of the descending aorta, but again, each patient needs to be assessed individually as to the specific treatment suggested.||A cardiologist puts an ultrasound probe through the mouth into the esophagus and can identify potential problems with the heart, heart valves, and the aorta.||However, certain medical problems, genetic conditions, and trauma can damage or weaken these walls.||Other symptoms can occur depending on where the aneurysm is located in the aorta and whether nearby structures are affected.||What are the symptoms of aortic dissection?||Symptoms

Often there are no symptoms accompanying aortic aneurysms, unless it is pressing on tissue or organs.||Other symptoms may be related to the location of the dissection within the aorta and whether it affects some of the branch arteries and occludes their blood supply.||Others force blood flow away from your organs and tissues, causing problems, such as heart attacks, kidney damage, stroke, and even death.||Aortic Aneurysm Symptoms

You might not know you have an aortic aneurysm because symptoms often don’t show up until it becomes large, or bursts.||Aortic aneurysms can develop and grow before causing any symptoms.||An aortic aneurysm often doesn't cause symptoms unless it ruptures.||Abdominal aortic aneurysms can remain asymptomatic or produce minimal symptoms for years.||Again, the presenting symptoms will depend upon the location of the dissection and what organs are involved.||When pain is felt in the back or flank, the symptoms can be misdiagnosed as kidney stones.||If you've been diagnosed with an aortic aneurysm that your doctor is watching, be on alert for symptoms of a rupture.||Another reason symptoms might appear is if the aneurysm causes dissection, meaning a tearing in the artery wall.||IMAGES

See a detailed medical illustration of the heart plus our entire medical gallery of human anatomy and physiology See Images

What are the early symptoms of an abdominal aortic aneurysm?||The portion of the aorta that is located in the chest (thorax) is referred to as the thoracic aorta, while the abdominal aorta is located in the abdomen.||Aortic aneurysms can develop anywhere along the length of the aorta but the majority are located in the abdominal aorta.||Most abdominal aortic aneurysms produce no symptoms (they are asymptomatic) and are discovered incidentally when an imaging test of the abdomen (CT scan or ultrasound) is performed.||Symptoms, depending on the location of the dissection, may include:

Blood pressure discrepancy between the arms

Pulse delay between arms and legs

Listening for fluid in the lung or for a new heart murmur may help assess the aortic valve

New stroke symptoms

Paraplegia

Diagnostic Testing

The initial tests for chest pain, an electrocardiogram, and a chest X-ray, are usually done.||The abdominal part of the aorta runs through the stomach area.||An aortic aneurysm is a dilation or bulging of the aorta.||The missing piece of the aorta is replaced with a synthetic graft.||It is important to consider not only the symptoms but also the risk factors of high blood pressure , genetic or family history, and the presence of other medical conditions that may predispose the patient to aortic dissection.||What is the thoracic and abdominal aorta?||The area of the aorta that is damaged is replaced with an artificial graft.||Ultimately, type A aortic dissections of the ascending aorta require surgery as the treatment of choice.||Treatment

If no symptoms are present, and depending upon other factors such as location and overall health, the aortic aneurysm may be closely monitored, using imaging to help track its status.||They'll either replace or reinforce the damaged section of your aorta to make it stronger.||The aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body.||Abnormalities of the connective tissue in the layers of the aortic wall can contribute to weakness in sections of the aorta.||About

Mild aortic ectasia is defined as an enlargement of the aorta that is mild in degree.||Since aneurysms are associated with atherosclerosis and plaque along the aortic wall and since aneurysms often contain a clot, debris can travel, or embolize, into smaller blood vessels and cause symptoms due to decreased blood flow.||The aorta has thick walls that stand up to normal blood pressure.||CT scan of the abdomen is highly accurate in determining the size and extent of the aneurysm and its location in the aorta.||Thoracic aortic aneurysm occurs in the chest portion of the aorta, above the diaphragm , and is less common.||The coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart begin at the origin of the aorta at the aortic valve.||The various sections of the aorta are named based on their relation to the heart and its location in the body.||The chest X-ray may show an abnormal shape to the aorta and a widened mediastinum (that space where the heart, aorta, vena cava, trachea, and esophagus sit in the chest cavity).||This is a less invasive procedure that uses a mesh sleeve to strengthen your aorta.||Chronically increased blood pressure causes the media layer to break down and leads to the continuous, slow dilation of the aorta.||The aorta is the large artery that exits the heart and delivers blood to the body.||The arteriosclerosis can weaken the aortic wall and the increased pressure of the blood being pumped through the aorta causes weakness of the inner layer of the aortic wall.||They are shaped like a spindle ("fusus" means spindle in Latin) with widen all around the circumference of the aorta.||The surgeon inserts a device called a stent graft, which expands and attaches to the inner wall of your aorta to provide support.||The layers add strength to the aorta as well as elasticity to tolerate changes in blood pressure .||CT scans require dye to be injected to evaluate the blood vessels (including the aorta).

Bona fides

[edit]

Further information: Mos maiorum

Bona fides is a Latin phrase meaning "good faith".||The lawyer's bona fides was/were questioned.||◊ Bona fides can be used with a singular or plural verb.||In contemporary English, bona fides is synonymous with credentials and identity.||As a legal concept, bona fides is especially important in matters of equity.||For the ancient Romans, bona fides was to be assumed by both sides, with implied responsibilities and both legal and religious consequences if broken.||The opposed concepts are bad faith, mala fides (duplicity) and perfidy (pretense).||[2] According to Roman law, "bona fides requires that what has been agreed upon be done" and was the principle of acting with integrity.||[3] Fides was one of the original virtues to be considered a divinity in ancient Roman religion.||Linguistically, in the U.S., American English usage of bona fides is synonymous with credentials, professional background, and documents attesting a person's identity, which is not synonymous with bona fide occupational qualifications.||Some Latin phrases have lost their literal meaning over centuries, but that is not the case with bona fides, which is still widely used and interchangeable with its generally accepted modern-day English translation of good faith.||[2]

CRT Cursor Control Mechanism Pad

To assist the operation of a cathode ray tube pointer 10 wherein a metal ball is rolled on a hard surface, the disclosed pad may be utilized.||[7][8]

That mouse was terrible at tracking on almost any surface, and build quality was awful.||As a result we had to fiddle with it so that it would make a good connection, and eventually, I ended up buying a wireless mouse on sale for around $10 from newegg.com

The age at which children gain brain control over their bladder varies.||A child should never be punished for wetting since this is something that is not under their control (it would be better to reward the child for voiding which is under their control).||The treatment for dysfunctional voiding depends on the type and cause of the dysfunctional voiding, as well as the patient's age and ability.||For children with a small capacity bladder, an anticholinergic medication may increase the bladder capacity.||Most, but not all, children in the United States have gained this control by 4 years of age.||At the Boston Children’s Center for Healthy Elimination and Bladder Rehabilitation (CHEER), we will evaluate your child to make sure that a more serious underlying medical or surgical issue isn’t responsible for their daytime wetting.||At the Boston Children’s Center for Healthy Elimination and Bladder Rehabilitation (CHEER), we will evaluate your child to make sure that a more

your child to make sure that a more serious underlying medical or surgical issue isn’t responsible for their daytime wetting.||The urine is checked to look for any signs of infection or kidney damage.||For children with a large bladder, who do not void often, the best treatment is frequent trips to the bathroom (about every 2 hours).||This type of brain control of the bladder is how children should become potty trained.||Our brain learns that it can control when the bladder contracts and also stop it from contracting.||It has taught me that they'll do it when feel ready and that pushing them is bad news for everyone.||Having the child void every 2 hours while sitting and relaxing for several minutes helps many children learn to void normally.||Since these bladders may be stretched out and not empty well, it is important for many of these children to sit down and spend several minutes trying to make sure the bladder is completely empty.||Unfortunately, once children begin this pattern, it is difficult for them to learn to relax these muscles when they try and urinate.||Children who have not developed brain control over their bladder may try to stay dry by contracting their sphincter muscles at the same time their bladder tries to empty.||me personally i wouldnt spend too much time on the potty, buy a toddler seat for the toilet and try get him on that.||to start potty training by a certain age and make it happen regardless.||This was followed by the usual wettings or clothes, peeing of bed, accidents here and there and everywhere, and worst of all a lot of upset for him.||When we are infants our bladders fill and empty without our control.||With my second son I left the potty out and waited until he decided he was ready to start using it (took a couple of months despite knowing what it was for).||Some children will require biofeedback methods to teach them to recognize how to control their sphincter muscles.||i think each childs bladder control is different but maybe try no drink 2 hours before bed, making sure he goes potty before you leave the house or put him on it every half an hour if needed!||If a child is past potty-training age (usually 5 years old) and has frequent daytime accidents, we recommend making an appointment with a pediatric urologist.||If a child is past potty-training age (usually 5 years old) and has frequent daytime accidents, we recommend making an appointment with a pediatric urologist.||If a child is past potty-training age (usually 5 years old) and has frequent daytime accidents, we

and bladder should do when you urinate-the sphincter relaxes at the same time the bladder muscle contracts.||Some children will require more invasive bladder tests.||An ultrasound probe gently placed on the skin surface above the bladder may be used to determine how much urine is left in the bladder after voiding.||By frequently and completely emptying the bladder the child reduces the chance of wetting or infections and starts to recognize the early signals from the bladder telling the brain that it's time to urinate.||The bladder is like a balloon inside your body that fills up with urine.||A voiding cystourethrogram, or VCUG, involves placing a catheter in the bladder.||The bladder is filled with liquid contrast material that shows up on an X-ray.||These catheters can monitor the exact pressures in the child's bladder during both filling and voiding.||Trying to "hold on" can damage the bladder and kidneys and teach the child improper voiding.||Children who contract their bladder against a closed sphincter need to learn to relax their sphincter when voiding.||To understand the different kinds of voiding dysfunction it is important to have an idea of how the bladder works.||The other hand rests on and around the balloon just like the bladder muscles (called the detrusor muscles).||After the bladder is filled, the catheter is removed and the child is asked to void and more X-rays are taken.||This test shows the shape of the bladder, how well it empties, and if any reflux up the ureters occurs.||In most children, the reason they develop the pattern of contracting their sphincter muscles at the same time their bladder contracts is unknown.||If the bladder is filled with contrast during a urodynamic test, X-rays can also be taken and the study is called a fluorourodynamic study.||Although most kids outgrow daytime wetting, they can experience social embarrassment and, as a result, emotional stress because of this problem.||The earlier the problem can be identified and treated, the better.||Then, we’ll work with your family to create a customized treatment plan tailored to your child’s individual needs.||This may include:

behavior modification

conditioning therapy

psychotherapy

The Consolidation Process

The typical consolidation process includes eight steps, illustrated in Figure 1 - 3:

1.||If the parent does not control 100 percent of a subsidiary, it must subtract the non-controlling portion from the net income or loss.||If the parent does not control 100 percent of a subsidiary, it must subtract the non-controlling portion from the net income or loss.||Merger and acquisition of many smaller companies into much larger ones

5.||The taxation term of consolidation refers to the treatment of a group of companies and other entities as one entity for tax purposes.||Statutory Consolidation: a business combination that creates a new company in which none of the previous companies survive.||Define Consolidation Charts of Accounts: Carefully planning your parent and subsidiary charts of accounts can help simplify the consolidation process.||Consolidation is the practice, in business, of legally combining two or more organizations into a single new one.||If the parent acquires 100 percent of the subsidiary at book value, then the consolidated balance sheet does not have to account for positive or negative differences between the purchase price and the book value of the acquired company, which is the difference between its assets and liabilities.||If the parent acquires 100 percent of the subsidiary at book value, then the consolidated balance sheet does not have to account for positive or negative differences between the purchase price and the book value of the acquired company, which is the difference between its assets and liabilities.||Examples of Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries

Volkswagen Group is an example of a wholly-owned subsidiary system.||The company does not need any entries to adjust this account balance unless the investment is considered impaired or there are liquidating dividends, both of which reduce the investment account.||In business, consolidation or amalgamation is the merger and acquisition of many smaller companies into a few much larger ones.||In the context of financial accounting, consolidation refers to the aggregation of financial statements of a group company as consolidated financial statements.||[2] A key concern of investors is that they cannot be sure what part of the reported cash position is owned by a 100% subsidiary and what part is owned by a 51% subsidiary.||[2] A key concern of investors is that they cannot be sure what part of the reported cash position is owned by a 100% subsidiary and what part is owned by a 51% subsidiary.||Wholly owned subsidiary: when the parent owns all the outstanding common stock of the subsidiary.||A wholly-owned subsidiary is 100% owned by the parent company, with no minority shareholders.||Advantages and Disadvantages of a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary

It is, however, possible (such as through special voting rights) for a controlling interest requiring consolidation to be achieved without exceeding 50% ownership, depending on the accounting standards being employed.||Despite being owned by another entity, a wholly-owned subsidiary may maintain its own management structure, clients, and corporate culture.||Upon consolidation, the original organizations cease to exist and are supplanted by a new entity.||Prepare Consolidation Data: You prepare your subsidiary balances before you transfer them to the parent.||Subsidiary vs. Wholly-Owned Subsidiary

A subsidiary is a company whose stock is more than 50% owned by a parent company or a holding company.||For example, a non-profit entity can create a for-profit subsidiary in order to raise revenue.||The parent company may opt for majority ownership rather than an outright purchase in order to lower the costs and risks involved in the venture.||Both Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) require companies to report the financial data of their subsidiaries if the parent company is public.

The death penalty is a moral issue for some and a policy issue for others.||However, it is also a government program with related costs and possible benefits.||Many people assume that the state saves money by employing the death penalty since an executed person no longer requires confinement, health care, and related expenses.||But in the modern application of capital punishment, that assumption has been proven wrong.||The death penalty is far more expensive than a system utilizing life-without-parole sentences as an alternative punishment.||Most cases in which the death penalty is sought do not end up with the death penalty being imposed.||And once a death sentence is imposed, the most likely outcome of the case is that the conviction or death sentence will be overturned in the courts.||The assessments of law enforcement experts are particularly relevant in identifying what expenditures are most effective in reducing crime.||In addition, DPIC has prepared a number of reports that relate to the question of costs and to the opinions of police chiefs and other experts in this field.||Written by: Howmuchisit.org Staff

A finger monkey, also known as a thumb monkey or Pygmy Marmoset, are tiny monkeys that only grow up to six inches tall.||A finger monkey is a relatively rare species that is the size of the average finger.||Coming from tropical regions, these monkeys will require special attention and care.||This is considered to be one fo the few exotic monkeys that can be kept as a pet.||This won’t include the food and startup fees such as its habitat.||On exoticanimalsforsale.net, there were a handful of marmoset finger monkeys up for adoption, with fees in the $4,000 to $6,000 range.||Finger monkey overview

A finger monkey, if healthy, can live anywhere from 15 to 25 years when in captivity.

Treat water in ponds

Making everything in the yard as dry as possible would be ideal to get rid of the pest but you may want to keep your nice Koi pond.||Get rid of (potential) water containers

In the war against the bugs standing water is the battlefront.||In summary

Getting rid of mosquitoes entirely in your garden may prove very difficult, perhaps impossible.||Depending on how they are employed, bug zappers seem to cause a decline in attacks eliminating the need for citronella torches, sprays, and long sleeves in the yard.||The more you get rid of spots that tend to gather water on wet days, the less swarming enemies you will encounter later on.||Mosquitoes can really take the fun out of spending time in the yard.||Depending on your situation you may not be able to get rid of the flying bugs completely but there’s a lot you can do to minimize the influx.||Treat your yard with a mosquito insecticide

Mosquitoes lay low in dense vegetation such as trees and shrubs but also in weeds.||According to the American Mosquito Control Association, bug zappers, also called black light insect electrocution devices do not reduce the amount of mosquitoes in your yard.||Treatment of water and taking away potential standing water vessels are the most efficient steps but even if you manage to make your yard completely free of breeding spots mosquitoes can fly in from miles away.||Users also point out that where you put it is essential to its ability to get rid of mosquitos and actually speak of “cost-efficient, environmenally-sensitive bug elimination.”

A popular tip offered on many websites is to get a bat or bird house.||You can get free mosquito fish at the Mosquito and Vector Control District.||This means that they interfere with the smelling ability of mosquitoes in the proximity.||Aedes mosquitoes prefer to lay eggs in low lying areas that flood from time to time.||Birds as keepers of the mosquito-free yard are another popular fallacy.||According to one study conducted in residential backyards, of the insects killed by these devices only 0.13% were female mosquitoes.||By reading this list in which we dispel myths and list methods that really work we you are setting the first step into a mosquito free yard (or at least a less pestered yard).||Mosquito traps do the exact opposite, they emit a stream CO2 to lure mosquitoes in.||Since these insects such as beetles and moths are natural enemies of other insect pests you may be actually increasing problems in your yard by using a zapper.||Mosquitoes do not lay eggs in disinfected and filtered swimming pools.||By introducing bat and bird houses to the yard you are supposedly creating a natural way of managing the skeeter problem.||Other causes of moist soil can be poor drainage, yard layout and soil composition.||Corrective Actions

Make your yard less attractive to the buzzing bugs with these measures.||The diet of Purple martins consists of about 3% mosquitoes according to research.||Similar devices use oscillating UV light and pulsing heat core systems to mimic subtle changes in human body temperature and thus attract mosquitoes and catch them in nets.||Inspect your yard for standing (rain) water.||Where possible, drain or fill non/flowing ditches, soil depressions and other soggy parts of the yard.||Mosquitoes lay eggs on the surface of standing water.||They mention finding hundreds of dead mosquitoes underneath the device and suspect it works well because it attracts and kills mosquitoes.||The less abundant water in puddles and the top soil layers the less chance for mosquitoes on successful breeding.||Vacuum and other traps

According to some these are the most powerful mosquito traps available because they lure with a CO2 plume and vacuum the mosquitoes in.||Burn pinion wood

The smoke of burning pinion and its pine scent wood repels mosquitoes according to some people.||Trimming back low foliage is another common practice that helps make your yard mosquito free.||Various studies demonstrate that mosquitoes form less than 1% of the diet of wild bats.||Contrary to popular belief, plants themselves do not repel mosquitoes.||The common glorification of plants and botanical mosquito sprays despite, mosquitoes are too persistent to be deterred by these measures.||Strategically placing the Flowtron bug zapper near the source of the mosquitoes (i.e.||With their fluorescent lights they are able to attract and kill thousands of insects in relatively short period of time.||Ditches containing stagnant water for one week or longer can produce large numbers of mosquitoes.||If your yard isn’t too big, using a pump sprayer (hose end sprayer) will suffice.||These scents are used to mask scents people emit thus interfering with mosquitoes looking for prey.||Zappers kill thousands of (beneficial) bugs each night and only a handful mosquitoes

However, some people swear by them

Reviewers claim that the Flowtron 80w (and 40w and 15w) kills mosquitoes, even without the use of an attractant.||We can always tell when the misting tank needs to be refilled because the mosquitoes show up.||The annual killifish (Nothobranchius guentheri) is another type of fish known to help limit the amount of larvae in ponds and other water bodies.

How Far Back Does a Criminal Background Check Go in New Jersey?||New Jersey Law on Use of Criminal Records

The New Jersey Opportunity to Compete Act is a "ban-the-box" law that prohibits employers with 15 or more employees from:

advertising in a job posting that applicants with a criminal record will not be considered for the position, or

asking job applicants about their criminal history during the initial application process, including on an employment application.||The New Jersey State Police frequently receives inquiries from government, business, and citizens on the regulations and procedures for obtaining an individual's criminal history record.||As discussed below, the seven-year rule doesn't apply to criminal background checks.||In New Jersey, employers may not ask about criminal history until the later stages of the application process.||authorizes the dissemination of New Jersey Criminal History Record Information (CHRI) by the New Jersey State Police (NJSP), Identification & Information Technology Section (I&ITS), State Bureau of Identification (SBI) for noncriminal justice purposes.||Criminal background checks won't reveal juvenile records, but your entire adult criminal history will be revealed in a background check unless your conviction has been expunged.||New Jersey also has a law similar to the federal FCRA.||New Jersey law gives applicants some protection in this situation, too.||Federal Protections for New Jersey Applicants With a Criminal Record

Employers are limited by two federal laws when seeking or considering an applicant's criminal records in hiring:

Federal antidiscrimination laws.||However, the law provides some exceptions where employers may ask about criminal history sooner, including if:

the position is in law enforcement, corrections, the judiciary, homeland security, or emergency management

a criminal background check for that position is required by law

an arrest or conviction of a particular crime would make the applicant ineligible for the position by law

the employer has a program designed to hire people with a criminal past, or

the applicant voluntarily discloses information about a criminal record.||Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, background checks of individuals who earn less than $75,000 per year can only look back seven years for certain types of information, including:

arrests not leading to conviction

bankruptcies

liens

civil judgments, and

civil lawsuits.||We provide employment law contract drafting and review, as well as advice on the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), New Jersey Family Leave Act (FLA) and related issues.||This law does not apply to serious offenses such as murder, rape, arson, robbery, and kidnapping.||Contact a New Jersey Employment Lawyer Today||New Jersey Administrative Code (N.J.A.C.)||In 2019, New Jersey passed the Clean Slate Law that allows individual with certain convictions over 10 years old to request that they be expunged.||What Is the Seven-Year Rule in Background Checks?||Learn more about our extensive Employment Law Practice:

Symptoms of GERD can be painful and, if allowed to continue, can lead to complications including esophagitis.||Quitting tobacco use

If you smoke or chew tobacco, try to quit or cut back.||Because the nicotine in tobacco is addicting, stopping the use of tobacco is more difficult than simply changing a habit.||Those who successfully quit using tobacco usually use a combination of these strategies.||Raise your bed if you have GERD symptoms when you are trying to sleep.||The nicotine from tobacco relaxes the valve between the esophagus and stomach (lower esophageal sphincter).||But in people with GERD, the sphincter may stay relaxed or relax at the wrong time.||Has anyone one on here who has-had GERD issue and smoked or chewed quit, and actually seen a difference.||Experts believe tobacco might worsen heartburn in a number of ways, including impairing the function of the LES, and increasing acidity.||Changing your eating habits

motox,

Hey there, hello,

When you eat, a muscular ring between the end of the esophagus and the entrance to the stomach -- called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) -- relaxes to let food in.||Once it has closed again, the stomach releases acids and enzymes to break down the food.||Usually, these acids stay put in the stomach.||This allows stomach contents containing acids and enzymes to wash back up, irritating the tissue of the esophagus.||I am sure you will be hearing from other members.||Take care,

Kitt, and no I do not chew..........||Esophagitis is irritation or inflammation of the esophagus.||Here are some things to try.||Stay at a weight that's healthy for you.||Extra weight puts more pressure on your stomach and makes you more likely to have heartburn.||Talk to your doctor if you need help losing weight.||Change your eating habits.||Try to eat several small meals instead of two or three large meals.

Summary of How to Build Wealth

The formula for how to build wealth is simple: spend less than you make and invest the difference wisely.||How Much Money Do I Need To Buy a Mutual Fund?||As you already know, the formula for how to build wealth is simple and fully proven.||It's an easy path to financial independence, and it's the not-so-secret “secret” to how to build wealth.||Start early

More than any one stock or mutual fund pick, the age you start investing will determine how much wealth you build.||The good news is that there are strategies that can help anyone build and preserve wealth over the long term.||By minimizing the impact of taxes, you can build wealth more effectively and preserve more of your hard-earned money over the long term.||Should I Pay Off Debt or Invest?||With patience, discipline, and a clear vision of your goals, you can achieve financial success and build wealth over the long term.||I know… you’re probably a little disappointed.||The advantage to this approach is there is no theoretical limitation to how fast your wealth can grow because your earning capacity is unlimited.||Habits are the easiest and simplest way for you to cross the bridge between how to build wealth using the simple formula above, and actually doing what it takes to achieve the goal.||Wealth Building Step 2: Wealth is Determined by Your Habits

The reason so few people build wealth is because they don’t adopt habits that lead to wealth.||Manage Debt and Build Your Credit

As you build wealth, you’ll start to find it worthwhile to take on debt to fund various purchases or investments.||How Investing Builds Wealth

Using the money you save to earn more money is the trick to building wealth.||Save Money

Simply making money won't help you build wealth if you end up spending it all.||Instead, I give you something dangerously close to what Grandma would have said.||As John Bogle wisely stated, “The secret is there are no secrets.”

The truth behind how to build wealth is public domain knowledge, simple to understand, and nobody is going to get rich selling it to you.||Related: Here’s a scientific system to build your wealth now

Instead, you just start today by adopting one habit that serves your wealth goals.||Think about what you do well and how you can use those talents to earn a living.||I’ve coached hundreds of people from debtors to the wealthy, and the pattern is unmistakable.||Then another and another until you can see your wealth grow.||Let's take a closer look at each of these principles and how they can help you achieve your financial goals.||Once you have a reasonable idea of how much money you can set aside each month, try to stick to it.||Key Takeaways

Building wealth over time requires an understanding of how to invest wisely, safeguard assets, and manage debt.||The reason good money habits are essential is actually scientific and results from the mathematics behind how money compounds to grow into wealth.||Here's the formula for how this works:

[(Small, Smart Choices) * (Consistency) * (Time)] = Wealth

Procrastination is the single biggest wealth killer.||Related: How to be a pro at growing your wealth

It's the quickest, most certain path to increased savings for investment.||How do you get there?||The Bottom Line

While get-rich-quick schemes sometimes may be enticing, the tried-and-true way to build wealth is through regular saving and investing—and patiently allowing that money to grow over time.||Decide whether you want:

Financial independence

Comfortable retirement savings

The ability to retire early

Money to start a business

Extra income each month

A financial safety net

Once you know your goal, that will help you determine:

How long you have to reach that goal

How much you need to save

How risky your investments can be

What type of investments to make

How much you should put into investments each month

Step 2: Start With a High-Interest Savings Account

Before you can begin investing, you have to save for your initial investment.||You don’t have to take investment seminars or build extraordinary expertise.||Notice how it's composed of three separate yet connected ideas to form a single concept:

Spend less

Earn more

Invest wisely

There are endless variations on how to achieve this objective, but they all follow two simple themes:

You can reduce spending immediately through various forms of frugality.||(more)

Five top investment strategists get together to discuss the forces that will shape the economy and the markets in the coming year � and how you can stay on top.||If you aim to put 10% of your income straight into investments, especially if you are allocating other funds to retirement savings, you will begin to build wealth and create a more stable financial future for yourself.||In short, you must create a gap between how much you earn and how much you spend that results in savings to invest for growth and additional income.||How have these principles worked for or against you in life?||Get This Article Sent to Your Inbox as a PDF…

Wealth Building Step 1: Spend Less Than You Make & Invest the Difference

The first sentence summarizes how to manage your personal finances so that you grow assets.||Here's how it looks in a different format: [(Small, Smart Choices) * (Consistency) * (Time)] = Wealth

The only question remaining is whether or not you will do what it takes.||You will perform better, build a longer-lasting career, and be more likely to succeed financially by doing something that you enjoy and find meaningful.||Everything You Need to Know About Building Wealth in Just Two Sentences

Building wealth is simple.||But those charts never answer this basic question: How do you get money to save in the first place?||Donate your wealth to charity?||After that, you can usually invest less.||Be specific about how much money you need to achieve each goal and the time frame you hope to achieve it.||Certificates of deposit (CDs) can be a good savings option if you can afford to lock up that money for several months or years.||This passively grows your wealth over time.||Some investments, such as stocks or bonds, can be sold at any time, while accounts like certificates of deposit may restrict when you can cash out.||The greatest obstacle to building wealth is procrastination.||This can earn you significant money, but it also requires high levels of attention to your investments and can cause you to lose significant amounts of money as well.

Calendar and Dates

The story starts on 1 November 1981, then jumps to 1991, where we follow Harry through his first year at Hogwarts and to his journey back to London at the end of June, 1992.||His loyalty and bravery in the face of a game of Wizard Chess plays a vital part in finding the Philosopher's Stone.||[14] The following year, Philosopher's Stone won almost all the other major British awards that were decided by children.||Both novelists greatly encourage re-reading, because details that look insignificant foreshadow important events or characters much later in the story-line – for example Sirius Black is briefly mentioned near the beginning of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and then becomes a major character in the third to fifth books.||[75] Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was released in London on 14 November 2001.||It is the first novel in the Harry Potter series and was Rowling's debut novel.||[24]

Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone won two publishing industry awards given for sales rather than literary merit, the British Book Awards Children's Book of the Year and the Booksellers' Association / Bookseller Author of the Year.||The headmaster of Hogwarts is the powerful, but kind wizard Albus Dumbledore, who becomes Harry's confidant.||The first character to be introduced is Vernon Dursley, Harry's uncle.

Unlike other Animal Crossing games, Happy Home Designer does not run in real-time.||Hello, and welcome to my Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer Blog!||If you don't yet own Happy Home Designer, you can buy it at Amazon.com.||How to Change your Hairstyle

Talk to Harriet and pay to have her change your hairstyle.||How about an Animal Crossing sticker book?||How to Change your Eye Color

If it has been fourteen days since you first changed your hairstyle with Harriet, you can ask Harriet to give you color contacts.||She can also change your appearance to match one of the Miis that you have created in Mii Maker.||Note: You can only get your hairstyle changed once per day.||She can change your hair style, hair color, and eye color.||By the way, after uploading the home to the Happy Home Network, the game said that I posted Cyrus's home...not Reese's.||Your answers determine the hairstyle that she gives you.||Opposite Gender Hairstyle

After Harriet has changed your hairstyle fifteen times, Harriet might offer to give you an opposite gender hairstyle.||Messy Hairstyle

If you don't play your game for fifteen days, your character will automatically have a "messy" hairstyle.||Your answers to her questions change the color that you get.||I uploaded the room to the Happy Home Network; enter project code 0425-7754-049 to give it a visit.||You can fix it by going back to Shampoodle and getting a new hairstyle.||How to Change your Hair Color

When changing your hair style, Harriet also asks questions about your desired hair color.||You can also take your Mii Mask off by opening your inventory, tapping your person, and selecting "remove hat".||Shampoodle's is a hair salon that you can unlock in Main Street.||The following chart displays the hairstyles you can get for your character based on your answers to Harriet's questions.||If you'd like, you can start from the beginning or just jump right in!||I'm Jeff and here you can follow along with my adventures in the game.||Your Mii Masks will be below your custom designs, which you can access by tapping the pencil tab on the touch screen.||Makeup

Harriet can also give you makeup to look like any Mii that you have saved in Mii Maker.||If you have the Beautiful Town ordinance in place, it will take longer for your hair to become the messy style.||Since she wanted everything to be white, I picked a snow-covered location for her home.||At Shampoodle's, you can talk to Harriet the poodle.||Sit in the styling chair and Harriet will ask you a series of questions.||You can put the mask on or take it off at any time.||Day 129

Whitney the wolf was out on Main Street today, and she wanted a refined home with lots of white furniture.||It's not perfect, but hopefully you can at least see the resemblance to Re-Tail.||To do that, you have to spend at least 8000 bells in the Able Sisters' shop.||Then, spend 10,000 bells in Able Sisters' or Kicks.||Kicks will open if it has been at least ten days since your town was created.||For the yard, I tried to recreate the location of Re-Tail in my New Leaf town of Forest.||A fluffy rug was placed outside her doorstep, and I filled in much of the empty space with white lillies.||I used some minimalist furniture in addition to the new items, and also a Cupid bench and a kitchen sink.||Note: Nintendo doesn't seem to store the room designs very long, so the project codes I've posted in many older entries will no longer be valid.||In addition to the wood bench, the following furniture is also unlocked with this project: The princess table, reception chair, cushion, box of tissues, and lily of the valley (potted flower).||If you'd like to shop stop on by, head over to project code 0574-7754-919.||The Mii Mask will also automatically be removed if you put on an accessory or other hat.||At the bottom of the page, you'll be able to find links to all of the entries.||Contents[ ]

How to Unlock Shampoodle's

To unlock Shampoodle's, you first have to unlock Kicks.||So some blog entries will cover multiple game days.||Or read my review.||Sorry, but I do not plan on re-uploading the old rooms again.||I decided to help her out.||I gave her a small zen house with a white brick exterior, white overlap roof, white lovely door, and a picket fence.||I then added some cedar trees, shrubs, and a newly-unlocked wood bench outside.||Inside, Whitney only insisted on two white flowers: Casablanca lillies and white carnations.

There are health conditions that can cause a loss of touch with reality, and there is no harm in seeing a doctor if you are concerned.||In addition, nearly every disease that causes a loss of reality isn't as temporary as those with anxiety experience.||If a person has milder symptoms of mania and does not lose touch with reality, it is called "hypomania" or a hypomanic episode.||Schizophrenia is a serious psychological disorder marked by delusions, hallucinations, loss of contact with reality, inappropriate affect, disorganized speech, social withdrawal, and deterioration of adaptive behavior.||The only way to ensure that your loss of reality doesn't come back, however, is to make sure that you're learning to stop extreme anxiety.||All Anxiety is Distorted Reality

Anxiety disorders all produce their own distorted reality, both as a symptom and as a function of what anxiety really is.||For example, pessimistic ideas may be out of proportion with the reality of the situation.||The symptoms of dissociative intoxication are also considered to mirror the symptoms of schizophrenia, including negative symptoms.||During a major depressive episode, thinking can get out of step with reality.||How to Get Back to Reality

It's important to remember that distorted reality from anxiety is not dangerous.||Anxiety is its own distorted reality.||This type of reality distortion is different for each individual, and its cause is not entirely clear.||Symptoms of major depression include:

loss of interest or pleasure

decreased or increased weight or appetite

decreased or increased sleep

appearing slowed or agitated

fatigue and loss of energy

feeling worthless or guilty

poor concentration or indecisiveness

thoughts of death, suicide attempts or plans.||But the easiest way to tell that you are not losing touch with reality is that you think that you are losing touch with reality.||Diagnosing psychosis in children and teenagers

Mental Retardation” (Heber 1959) and adopted by the American Association on Mental Deficiency as well as the Biometrics Branch, National Institute of Mental Health, is that all those at least one standard deviation below the population mean intelligence quotient (IQ) are considered retarded.||Perhaps the question is not how to improve the cognitive functioning of familial retardates but rather how to maximize the adjustment of such individuals, whatever their intellectual capacity may be.||His findings clearly indicate that on all his tasks requiring verbal mediation, the retarded subjects have considerable difficulty.||The very nature of the empirical distribution of IQs below the mean, especially in the 0-50 range (see Penrose 1949) seems to demand such an approach.||For a complete listing of the many types of mental retardation the reader is referred to the “Manual on Terminology and Classification in Mental Retardation” (Heber 1959).||Familial retardates, on the other hand, are almost invariably mildly retarded, usually with IQs above 50.||The diseases that are usually associated with severe retardation may cause the shorter life span.||Many environmental influences on

effects of institutionalization, the factors that led to the child’s institutionalization, or some complex interaction between these factors and institutionalization.||It is defined as an intellectual functioning level (as measured by standard tests for intelligence quotient) that is well below average and significant limitations in daily living skills (adaptive functioning).||Developmental delay may indicate a problem in development of the central nervous system.||A diagnosis of mental retardation is made if an individual has an intellectual functioning level well below average and significant limitations in two or more adaptive skill areas.||On the basis of differences in performance between retardates and normals on some experimental task rather than on physiological evidence, they have advanced the view that all retardates suffer from some specifiable defect over and above their general intellectual retardation.||However, this accomplishment does not indicate that the retardate has become normal in intelligence.||Mental retardation is defined as IQ score below 70-75.||The data of Table 1 would indicate that the incidence fluctuates not only across age categories but also according to the locality.||The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) is the diagnostic standard for mental healthcare professionals in the United States.||In the area of mental retardation, social competence usually means the ability to maintain oneself without too frequent contact with state schools, state hospitals, welfare agencies, and police officers.||In either case, the more important questions involve an understanding of exactly how such cognitive processes develop over the life span and exactly how innate and environmental factors interact to influence such development.

[edit]

For an exact test used in place of the 2 × 2 chi-squared test for independence, see Fisher's exact test.||To reduce the error in approximation, Frank Yates suggested a correction for continuity that adjusts the formula for Pearson's chi-squared test by subtracting 0.5 from the absolute difference between each observed value and its expected value in a 2 × 2 contingency table.||For the workweek test, with 1 df , the chi-square-crit is 3.84, whereas his chi-square-calc was 0.167.||For the workweek test, with 1 df , the chi-square-crit is 3.84, whereas his chi-square-calc was 0.167.||Basically, if the chi-square you calculated was bigger than the critical value in the table, then the data did not fit the model, which means you have to reject the null hypothesis.||Basically, if the chi-square you calculated was bigger than the critical value in the table, then the data did not fit the model, which means you have to reject the null hypothesis.||Yates's correction for continuity

Main article: Yates's correction for continuity

Using the chi-squared distribution to interpret Pearson's chi-squared statistic requires one to assume that the discrete probability of observed binomial frequencies in the table can be approximated by the continuous chi-squared distribution.||This conclusion caused some controversy in practical applications and was not settled for 20 years until Fisher's 1922 and 1924 papers.||Because of the lack of symmetry of the chi-square distribution, separate tables are provided for the upper and lower tails of the distribution.||Because of the lack of symmetry of the chi-square distribution, separate tables are provided for the upper and lower tails of the distribution.||There are also χ2 tests for testing the null hypothesis of independence of a pair of random variables based on observations of the pairs.||McNemar's test, used in certain 2 × 2 tables with pairing

Likelihood-ratio tests in general statistical modelling, for testing whether there is evidence of the need to move from a simple model to a more complicated one (where the simple model is nested within the complicated one).||The test statistic T in this instance could be set to be the sum of squares about the sample mean, divided by the nominal value for the variance (i.e.||The significance level, α, is demonstrated with the graph below which shows a chi-square distribution with 3 degrees of freedom for a two-sided test at significance level α = 0.05.||The significance level, α, is demonstrated with the graph below which shows a chi-square distribution with 3 degrees of freedom for a two-sided test at significance level α = 0.05.||For example, if the probability model is Gaussian, then \( \theta = (\mu, \sigma) \), where \( \mu \) and \( \sigma \) denote the mean and standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution.||Note that, in general, this cumulative distribution function depends on a possibly vectorial parameter, \( \theta \), hence the notation \( F_{\theta} \) in the foregoing equation for \( E_{i} \).||By the assumption of independence under the hypothesis we should "expect" the number of white-collar workers in neighborhood A to be

150 × 349 650 ≈ 80.54 {\displaystyle 150\times {\frac {349}{650}}\approx 80.54}

The sum of these quantities over all of the cells is the test statistic; in this case, ≈ 24.57 {\displaystyle \approx 24.57} .||Chi-squared tests often refers to tests for which the distribution of the test statistic approaches the χ2 distribution asymptotically, meaning that the sampling distribution (if the null hypothesis is true) of the test statistic approximates a chi-squared distribution more and more closely as sample sizes increase.||Suppose that n observations in a random sample from a population are classified into k mutually exclusive classes with respective observed numbers of observations xi (for i = 1,2,…,k), and a null hypothesis gives the probability pi that an observation falls into the ith class.||History

[edit]

In the 19th century, statistical analytical methods were mainly applied in biological data analysis and it was customary for researchers to assume that observations followed a normal distribution, such as Sir George Airy and Mansfield Merriman, whose works were criticized by Karl Pearson in his 1900 paper.||Chi-squared test for variance in a normal population

[edit]

If a sample of size n is taken from a population having a normal distribution, then there is a result (see distribution of the sample variance) which allows a test to be made of whether the variance of the population has a pre-determined value.||Example chi-squared test for categorical data

However, CD4 testing is not a substitute for anergy testing.||Any induration to a DTH antigen measured at 48 hours to 72 hours is considered evidence of DTH responsiveness; failure to elicit a response is considered evidence of anergy.||When an individual is in a state of anergy, it signifies that their immune system is incapable of mounting a typical response against a specific antigen, typically a self-antigen.||Anergy testing is a diagnostic procedure used to obtain information regarding the competence of the cellular immune system.||Anergy is also more common among persons infected with HIV who are asymptomatic than among comparable persons without HIV infection.||With equipment in over 50 countries Anergy is already well set up to provide spare parts and support across the globe.||Although the sensitivity of these tests may be high, their use as quantitative tools for assessment of anergy is limited.||Another theory coming from autoimmune research, which is underlined by several reports, suggests that anergy (as induced by costimulation blockade) is an intermediate between auto-/alloreactive T cells that eventually become Tregs [55].||Therefore, anergy testing is no longer recommended as a routine component of TB screening among HIV-infected persons in the United States.||A positive DTH response to anergy testing, in conjunction with a negative PPD skin-test result, has been interpreted as evidence that the negative PPD test result is a true negative and the person tested is not infected with M. tuberculosis.||BACKGROUND Anergy in HIV Disease and Risk for Active TB in HIV-Infected Persons

Anergy skin testing assesses the responses to skin-test antigens to which a cell-mediated, delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response is expected.||CONCLUSIONS

Recent studies suggest that impaired DTH is related to risk for active TB in some HIV-infected populations, despite variability in anergy skin-testing procedures.||One such interaction is between programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1), which is expressed by the T cell, and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), which is the ligand for PD-1; the expression of PD-L1 on a target cell binding to PD-1 can inhibit T-cell receptor signaling and diminish interactions with dendritic cells, resulting in anergy.||The Anergy Pyrolyser

HTP is made possible by the unique design of the Anergy kiln and extensive experience in HTP (over 200 installations in over 50 countries) means that Anergy brings a unique combination of cutting edge design with industrial plant building experience.||[2]

At the cellular level, "anergy" is the inability of an immune cell to mount a complete response against its target.||Therefore, anergy testing in conjunction with PPD-tuberculin testing is no longer routinely recommended for inclusion in screening programs for M. tuberculosis infection among HIV-infected persons.||However, anergy testing at the time of initial tuberculin testing is preferable, because of logistical problems and nonadherence associated with repeat testing and reading.||However, HIV-infected persons may have compromised ability to react to PPD-tuberculin skin testing, because HIV infection is associated with an elevated risk for cutaneous anergy.||Studies are also needed to determine the usefulness of repeating anergy tests (e.g., 2- step testing as is suggested for certain persons being PPD tested).||DTH responsiveness is measured by mumps and Candida (trichophyton was removed from the anergy panel because it elicited many fewer DTH responses than the other two antigens).||Because of the expectation that second strength (250 TU), PPD tuberculin, would be less sensitive than the other antigens in eliciting a DTH response, second strength PPD is not recommended for anergy evaluation; (nor is it recommended for evalua- tion for tuberculous infection).||However, HIV-infected persons may have compromised ability to react to PPD-tuberculin skin testing, because HIV infection is associated with an elevated risk for cutaneous anergy (8,9).||If a decision is made to perform anergy testing, technical expertise, feasibility, and cost may be important factors in choosing which test(s) to employ.||Although CD4 counts should be performed as a part of the evalu- ation and management of persons with HIV infection, this measurement is not a substitute for anergy evaluation.||Only a small proportion of the population is sensitive to tuberculin; sensitivity to histoplasmin and coccidioidin is restricted to endemic regions of infections.||Studies of tuberculosis disease associated with HIV infection indicate that a substantial proportion of tuberculosis patients will have PPD anergy if their tuberculosis is concurrent with other HIV- related opportunistic infections.||Therefore, the use of anergy testing in conjunction with PPD testing is no longer recommended routinely for screening programs for M. tuberculosis infection conducted among HIV-infected persons in the United States.||Any amount of induration to the DTH antigens is considered evidence of DTH responsiveness; erythema alone is not considered to be evidence of DTH responsiveness.||[2] B-cell anergy can be induced by exposure to soluble circulating antigen, and is often marked by a downregulation of surface IgM expression and partial blockade of intracellular signaling pathways.||Blocking of the pathway leading to the anergy can be also done by cyclosporin A, which is capable of inhibiting calcineurin – the phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylating of NFAT priming its activation.||The applicability of skin-testing methods to pediatric populations is uncertain.||Such immune response is anticipatory and its specificity is assured by pre-existing clones of lymphocytes, which expand in response to specific antigen (process called "clonal selection").||Impaired DTH response, which is directly related to decreasing CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, is a predictive factor for progression of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and mortality in HIV-infected persons (11-14).||Anergic, tuberculin-negative persons whose risk of tuberculous infection is estimated to be greater than or equal to 10% should also be considered for isoniazid preventive therapy after active tuberculosis is excluded.||Anergy or DTH tests placed by using the Mantoux method of intradermal injection have conventionally been classified as positive if an induration measuring greater than or equal to 5 mm is observed at the injection site within 48-72 hours.||The purpose of anergy testing also may be a factor: if the primary concern is to avoid misclassifying anergic persons as nonanergic, the use of two Mantoux-method tests with a 5-mm of induration cut-off may be appropriate.||Anergy and Risk for Active TB

In studies conducted both in the United States and elsewhere, no definite association has been determined between anergy and the risk for active TB in HIV-infected persons; the results of these studies indicated that the magnitude of the risk is variable and the reason for the variation uncertain.||Lack of DTH response to anergy skin testing, in conjunction with a negative PPD skin-test result, has been interpreted as evidence that the person is unable to mount a positive response to PPD even if infected with M. tuberculosis.||Similarly to recessive tolerance, unopposed NFAT signalling is also important for T-reg induction.||This specific clonal army then combats the pathogen until the body is free of the infection.||Limited information is available regarding the sensitivity and specificity of the two FDA-approved DTH tests used together.||The use of this product, however, is likely to be limited by cost and availability.||This preventive therapy is indicated even if the date of PPD skin-test conversion cannot be determined.||ROLE OF ANERGY SKIN TESTING IN TB PREVENTION AND CONTROL PROGRAMS

Isoniazid preventive therapy administered to HIV-positive persons who have positive reactions to PPD tuberculin is important both as a personal health intervention and as part of efforts to prevent active TB disease in the United States.||Among these pathways, the calcium-dependent arm of lymphocyte signaling is particularly pivotal, triggered by TCR engagement.||Selective nonreactivity to PPD is a recognized phenomenon in some patients with active culture-positive TB (22,23).||It is an intradermal test of skin reactivity (similar to tuberculin tests) in which a control (glycerol) is used with seven antigens of bacterial or fungal origin (tetanus toxoid, tuberculin, diphtheria, streptococcus, candida, trichophyton, and proteus).||The conventional cut-off measurement of induration diameter for interpreting a Mantoux-method skin-test result as positive is 5 mm of induration.||Isoniazid preventive therapy is effective in reducing the incidence of active TB among persons who have HIV infection and latent TB.||Here anergy is defined as a region of skin reactivity of 0–1 mm, hypoergy as a reaction of 2–9 mm in response to fewer than three antigens, normergic as a reaction of 10–39 mm or to three or more antigens, and hyperergy for a reaction of 40 mm or more.

Late complications of fractures

Local

Delayed union (fracture takes longer than normal to heal).||Problems with bone healing (non-union, delayed union and malunion)

Delayed union is failure of a fracture to consolidate within the expected time - which varies with site and nature of the fracture and with patient factors such as age.||A delayed union is when a fracture takes longer than usual to heal.||Non-union is one endpoint of delayed union.||Learn more: Tibia (Shinbone) Shaft Fractures

Symptoms

Patients with nonunions usually feel pain at the site of the break long after the initial pain of the fracture disappears.||Failure of a bone to heal after breakage

For the meaning in organized labour, see Trade union and Union shop.||Failure of a bone to heal after breakage

For the meaning in organized labour, see Trade union and Union shop.||[2]

Signs and symptoms

[edit]

A history of a broken bone is usually apparent.||[2]

Signs and symptoms

[edit]

A history of a broken bone is usually apparent.||Depending on the severity of the nonunion, symptoms also can include:

Reduced functioning in the affected area.||Therefore, the patient's symptoms will not be improved and the function of the limb will remain impaired.||Therefore, the patient's symptoms will not be improved and the function of the limb will remain impaired.||Depending on the severity, additional malunion symptoms can include:

Reduced functioning in the affected area.||Absence of callus (remodelled bone) or lack of progressive change in the callus suggests delayed union.||Medical

In some cases, union can be achieved without surgery.||Management of non-union

Non-surgical approaches:

Early weight bearing and casting may be helpful for delayed union and non-union.||A non-union which does go on to heal is called a delayed union.||A non-union which does go on to heal is called a delayed union.||Usually, there are signs of union within 3 months, but the treatment may continue for many months beyond that.||Usually, there are signs of union within 3 months, but the treatment may continue for many months beyond that.||Failure of initial union, as when bone fragments are separated by soft tissue, may also lead to an atrophic non-union.||Failure of initial union, as when bone fragments are separated by soft tissue, may also lead to an atrophic non-union.||However, non-union is generally said to occur when all healing processes have ceased and union has not occurred.||Factors disposing to non-union

Delayed union and non-union occurs in approximately 5-10% of all fractures but is more common in open long bone fractures (17% non-union) or where there is motion at the fracture site.7 Risk factors are all of those above and also:

Too large a space for bony remodelling to bridge.||The patient complains of persistent pain at the fracture site and may also notice abnormal movement or clicking at the level of the fracture.||The patient complains of persistent pain at the fracture site and may also notice abnormal movement or clicking at the level of the fracture.||Normal fracture healing

Immobilization of the fracture with internal or external fixation.||[10]

Immobilization of the fracture with internal or external fixation.||Complicated/compound fracture.||Iatrogenic complications of fracture treatment

Casts

Poor cast placement may lead to problems of malunion, either because the bones are not accurately aligned or because the fracture is not sufficiently immobilised.||The evidence supporting the use of ultrasound and shockwave therapy for improving unions is very weak[15] and it is likely that these approaches do not make a clinically significant difference for a delayed union or non-union.||The evidence supporting the use of ultrasound and shockwave therapy for improving unions is very weak[15] and it is likely that these approaches do not make a clinically significant difference for a delayed union or non-union.||Presentation of non-union

Pain at fracture site, persisting for months or years.||[9] CT scans offer a closer look at the fracture and may also be used to evaluate how much of the fracture has healed.||[9] CT scans offer a closer look at the fracture and may also be used to evaluate how much of the fracture has healed.||The physician and patient should always discuss the risks and benefits of using these medications during fracture healing

Infection

A complicated open fracture (also known as a compound fracture); with an open fracture, there is an open wound near the fracture, usually caused by a piece of bone breaking through the skin

Blood Supply

Nonunions are more likely to happen if the injured bone has a limited blood supply.||[1]

Nonunion is a serious complication of a fracture and may occur when the fracture moves too much, has a poor blood supply or gets infected.||[1]

They have always been such an adorable couple and there is obviously still love between them.||LUIS MIGUEL, 46

The Mexican singer and Mariah had a three-year romance from 1999, but he found the media circus too much to take.||A close family friend revealed: “James had huge reservations about Mariah’s TV show and the fact that she was willing to expose their lives to the world.”

James is said to be in such a rush to cut ties with Mariah, 46, that he will let her keep the 35-carat diamond and platinum engagement ring.||However, the singer’s representative has denied the split was due to infidelity or her excessive spending, saying: “Mariah and James had a fight in Greece, and have not seen each other since.||They’re not sure if they will stay together.”

James was noticeably absent from Mariah’s Halloween party last weekend, with the singer posing for photos with Bryan, ex-husband Nick Cannon and their twins, Moroccan and Monroe.||CHRISTIAN MONZON, 39

Mariah dated the model for a year from 2005.||AFTER two failed marriages, it seemed that Mariah Carey had finally met her Dreamlover.||To add fuel to the fire, Mariah was joined by Bryan when she went to Nobu.||He missed his sister Gretel’s 50th birthday bash in August because Mariah refused to attend.||But life happens.”

Now unlucky in love Mariah is left with another failed relationship to recover from.||After the break-up, Mariah’s mother reportedly told police: “She’s cracking up.||This isn’t the only time James has shown his fiery side, with the singer’s friends claiming that he “is not in his right mind” and Mariah was left with no choice but to leave him.||When Bryan suffered a knee injury that left him unable to perform in May, Mariah gave him a saucy lapdance on stage.||Sources say James even used his casino ties to have the dancer banned from Caesars Palace, where Mariah has a high-paying residency.||Mariah will need to be legally separated from Nick in order to marry her fiance James, who she got engaged to in January.||Mariah’s friends have hit back with claims that he became crazed over her “close relationship” with hunky dancer Bryan Tanaka.||Mariah will need to be legally separated from Nick in order to marry her fiance James, who she got engaged to in January.||After the hosts asked about whether she'll have a reception or 'after-party' Mariah replied 'Reception is for if you have a big wedding.||After the hosts asked about whether she'll have a reception or 'after-party' Mariah replied 'Reception is for if you have a big wedding.||“When they’re on one of the boats, she has her stylist fly in outfits on a helicopter and she spends tens of thousands of dollars in minutes.”

Another source said: “James is very generous, but Mariah takes it to the next level.”

Former Scientologist James, who is worth around £2.8billion, is also said to have struggled with the singer’s decision to feature their relationship in her new reality TV show Mariah’s World, which premieres on E!||A close friend of the 49-year-old tycoon revealed: “Mariah spends £80,000 a month ordering exotic flowers from around the world to where she happens to be.||I think she’s going to kill herself.”

So, incontinence problems that develop over a period of just a few weeks are something to pay attention to.”

The difficulty in differentiating symptoms of abdominal pain and urinary incontinence as ovarian cancer predictors lies in the many different diseases or conditions to which these symptoms may point.||Results from an Olmsted Medical Center and Mayo Clinic study analyzing symptoms recorded in the medical records of ovarian cancer patients suggest ovarian cancer, long considered asymptomatic until late-stage cancer develops, does in fact have early symptoms, including urinary incontinence and abdominal pain.||Abdominal pain and urinary urgency, frequency or incontinence were the most commonly documented symptoms in women who had Stage I and II, the early stages, of ovarian cancer.||Signs and symptoms

So what are the common signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer?||Signs and symptoms

So what are the common signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer?||Yawn and Barrette suggest that women and their doctors be particularly alert to incontinence and abdominal pain that do not improve with treatment.||They found that:

the most common presenting symptom (in 22 per cent of cases) was crampy abdominal pain which lasted for longer than two weeks, and wasn't associated with diarrhoea or vomiting;

18 percent had urinary symptoms such as incontinence (lack of bladder control) that grew increasingly worse over a two or three week period;

in fewer than a quarter of cases were there gynaecological symptoms, like irregular vaginal bleeding.||They found that:

in fewer than a quarter of cases were there gynaecological symptoms, like irregular vaginal bleeding.||Urinary incontinence is most likely due to the tumor’s pressing on the bladder and causing increased pressure within the abdomen, prompting urine loss.||“My surprise with our findings was at the urinary incontinence, because it’s not something that has been reported often,” she says.||Even when it does produce symptoms, those symptoms are often vague, and they're symptoms that are also present in many other abdominal and pelvic conditions.||Even when it does produce symptoms, those symptoms are often vague, and they're symptoms that are also present in many other abdominal and pelvic conditions.||If you have any of these symptoms, question your doctor about ovarian cancer and whether you need a pelvic examination and further tests.||If you have any of these symptoms, question your doctor about ovarian cancer and whether you need a pelvic examination and further tests.||Brigitte Barrette, M.D., a Mayo Clinic gynecologist and study investigator, found the commonality of urinary leakage symptoms among the ovarian cancer patients particularly interesting.||Cancer of the ovary can grow quite large and spread before it starts to produce these symptoms.||Cancer of the ovary can grow quite large and spread before it starts to produce these symptoms.||Fewer than 25 percent of the symptoms would be considered unique to ovarian cancer or related directly to the reproductive pelvic organs: the uterus, fallopian tubes, cervix and ovaries.||“Many of the symptoms are more common in other conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome or colon cancer,” says Dr.||If the symptoms persist and there is not a clear reason, you need to look further.” At a minimum, the symptoms require a pelvic examination with an ultrasound and a blood test for ovarian cancer if they do not resolve or do not have another very clear diagnosis within weeks — not months, agree Drs.||Yawn explains that from the data collected in this study, the investigators are unable to draw conclusions about whether catching a patient’s symptoms early in the progression of ovarian cancer will make a difference in the treatability of her cancer.||What happens at the GP appointment

The most common symptom found in the records of the 107 ovarian cancer patients studied was crampy abdominal pain.||But, that should be considered.”

Due to the fact that the symptoms identified in this study can be indicative of many conditions, Drs.||It's statistically far more likely a woman with these symptoms will turn out to have something else - irritable bowel syndrome, a urinary infection, or uterine fibroids for example.||It's statistically far more likely a woman with these symptoms will turn out to have something else - irritable bowel syndrome, a urinary infection, or uterine fibroids for example.||“When a woman goes in to see her doctor with these abdominal, urinary or pelvic symptoms and the tests for the most common causes are negative, the workup needs to continue,” says Dr.||Ovarian cancer occurs in 1 out of 70 women||One is that there is unfortunately no routine, cost-effective screening test for ovarian cancer (the Pap smear is only effective for the early detection of cancer of the cervix, not ovarian cancer).||One is that there is unfortunately no routine, cost-effective screening test for ovarian cancer (the Pap smear is only effective for the early detection of cancer of the cervix, not ovarian cancer).||So in many cases a doctor doesn't think of ovarian cancer.||Like most cancers, the risk of ovarian cancer increases with age.||So in many cases a doctor doesn't think of ovarian cancer.||Like most cancers, the risk of ovarian cancer increases with age.||One of the most worrying conditions a woman can get is ovarian cancer.||One of the most worrying conditions a woman can get is ovarian cancer.||Other things that can raise your risk of ovarian cancer include:

I know it's tough because you don't want to have these things visible with your dress, but have you thought about tanning lotion?||The only problem I foresee with going to a tanning salon, as many people have already mentioned is that shingles is contagious and you don't want to feel responsible for passing this "wonderful" little gift on... if lotion is not your thing(cause you think it'll make you orange) I would try out a place that does those spray tans.||We caught it in time and I've had no other problems, but it did scare me enough to make me stop tanning in a tanning bed and to ALWAYS used sunscreen while outside.||I am 23 yrs old and 2 years ago I had a sore that later turned into a scab on my arm.||If you have exposed lesions that have not healed over, you should not be tanning at all.||If you are taking acyclovir for shingles (which is a must if you can), this particular drug can have adverse effects in conjunction with strong sunlight.||I don't have advice on the shingles, but you should reconsider the tanning.||Other people can get chicken pox from you until they are healed.||Some people, infants being one, can get this from you.||I cannot prove that my use of that tanning bed caused my shingles, but otherwise I am a healthy, non-stressed, 40-yr-old female.||Heat is one of the worst things you can do for the rash.||You cannot however pass on Shingles to someone who has already had Chicken Pox.||If you just started tanning recently for the wedding, is it even possible that this was a stress to your body that triggered your first outbreak...

I see this question is quite dated, but I recently developed a rash after two tanning sessions at an Xsport Fitness Express.||This happens when melanocytes – skin cells that make pigment – are attacked and destroyed, causing the skin to turn a milky-white color.||In all the research I did on shingles, I learned that sunlight (real of fake)will only make the rash worse.||This happens when melanocytes – skin cells that make pigment – are attacked and destroyed, causing the skin to turn a milky-white color.||Lemon Juice, salt and a loofa work wonders;) If it works well you can get it touched up right before the wedding and ta da!||Sunlight can also causes permanent scarring.||They can collect in the sores, causing a darkening of the skin in that spot, and can result in a permanent scar.||Tanning a lot is never good for your skin, with or without a rash.||What people don�t know about herbs can hurt them.||Once it's in your system, it can resurface at any time.||4 weeks is still plenty of time to be outside in the sun without having to go to a tanning bed!||I don't know, but I do know that I will never use tanning beds ever again for the rest of my life!||I wish you luck with the wedding and ask you to judge whether you really need that tan enough!||Hope you figure out a solution that works for you!||So, I would say, NO, NO ONE SHOULD USE PUBLIC TANNING BEDS IF THEY HAVE A RASH OR SOME TYPE OF DISEASE!||Sometimes, there can be a rapid loss of color or pigment and even cover a large area.||Sometimes, there can be a rapid loss of color or pigment and even cover a large area.||There is some anecdotal evidence that exposure to sunlight (either fake or natural) can exacerbate the symptoms of shingles.||I would forego the sun and tanning bed exposure, and look into using something along the lines of Sally Hansen's leg make-up to enhance the look of a tan.||You do this at your own risk.||The entire nerve is inflamed by the chicken pox virus, so you are not dealing with a dermatological issue, you are trying to heal much more under the surface so topical applications will probably not help you.||If it is your waist, or thigh or buttock wear a large pair of thick pants (underwear)... hey you wont get an all over tan.... but you have the best of both worlds - a tan where you need it, and a protected shingles rash where you don't.||It could be the stress of a cold or the stress of homework, but it pops up nearly every time, so you should know that it may come back, and you will need to know what causes this for you.||Sadly if you have had Chicken Pox as a child, there is every chance that you will suffer from Shingles at some point in your life.||i.e you are likely to go red as a lobster!||I'd just ask that you respect the safety of others.||If you have a medical condition, consult your health care practitioner.||Also -- do not use self tanners when you have sores of any kind!||I've heard they work great and it'll probably give you better coverage over the rash.||Until the scabs have healed over you could be infectious to people who have never had Chicken Pox.||Although the VZV virus that causes chickenpox and shingles disease can spread through the direct contact of any healthy person (who never had chickenpox in his/her life) with the open wounds/rashes/blisters of the patient suffering from shingles disease, Shingles is not a fully contagious disease.||A healthy person can never develop Shingles disease after he/she comes in informal contact (not involving much of physical contact, or a direct contact with the rash) with the patient suffering from Shingles, or sneezing or coughing of patient when the healthy person is in vicinity.||Firstly if you are going to use a sun bed with this condition try to use a stand up cabin rather than a bed.||Try it out like tomorrow to give yourself enough time between the wedding and if you don't like it there are ways to scrub it off your skin.||Let us be clear, sunbeds are not good for you full stop - but then quite often we knowingly do things that are bad for us all the time.||Dear A.,

I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it sounds like you're going to have to choose between more rash and scars, or a tan.||Join Date: Jul 16 2004

The Sortino ratio can also be used in trading.||Measurement in finance

The Sortino ratio measures the risk-adjusted return of an investment asset, portfolio, or strategy.||[3]

Practitioners who use a lower partial Standard Deviation (LPSD) instead of a standard deviation also tend to use the Sortino ratio instead of the Sharpe ratio.||The Sortino ratio is used as a way to compare the risk-adjusted performance of programs with differing risk and return profiles.||Usage

[edit]

The Sortino ratio is used to score a portfolio's risk-adjusted returns relative to an investment target using downside risk.||[4]

The ratio S {\displaystyle S} is calculated as

S = R − T D R {\displaystyle S={\frac {R-T}{DR}}} ,

where R {\displaystyle R} is the asset or portfolio average realized return, T {\displaystyle T} is the target or required rate of return for the investment strategy under consideration (originally called the minimum acceptable return MAR), and D R {\displaystyle DR} is the target semi-deviation (the square root of target semi-variance), termed downside deviation.||This is analogous to the Sharpe ratio, which scores risk-adjusted returns relative to the risk-free rate using standard deviation.||This method is conceptually and operationally incorrect and negates the foundational statistic of post-modern portfolio theory as developed by Brian M.

Skin reactions, such as swelling, a rash, hives or eczema

Wheezing or difficulty breathing

Runny nose and sneezing

Red or watery eyes

Stomach pain, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea

Anaphylaxis (less common)

If you or your child experiences any of these symptoms, see an allergist.||Chicken allergy is nothing to be ashamed of.||The worst complication of having chicken allergy is anaphylaxis.||Chicken allergies aren’t common, but they can cause uncomfortable or even dangerous symptoms in some people.||A chicken allergy can occur in people of any age.||These symptoms include having a runny or stuffed nose, mild fever, watery eyes, and difficulty with breathing.||Some of the treatments for chicken allergy include:

Adrenaline shots can be given to treat chicken allergy.||Causes of Chicken Allergy

Like it is the case with the most allergies, both common and uncommon, the cause of a person developing a chicken allergy is unknown.||Watch out for the following symptoms in you and other if you come in contact with chickens, or you eat chicken meat.||You or someone near you should also call for an ambulance, even if epinephrine provides relief, as the symptoms may recur.||Chicken allergy can happen to every person regardless of their age and race.||Although many people have never heard of something such as the chicken allergy, we must say that chicken allergy is real and that is not that uncommon allergy.||As we have said, almost 5% percent of the population has chicken allergy.||Your allergist will teach you how to use the auto-injector, which should be kept with you at all times and used as soon as symptoms start to appear.||If you have bird-egg syndrome, you may also have an increased risk of an allergy to parakeets.||People with chicken allergy also have gastrointestinal issues as their body tries to get rid of the allergen.||Try with all of your strength to accept that fact that there is no cure for your allergy.||Almost 5% of the American population has chicken allergy and has to cope with it every single day.||If your cat has allergies, some of the most common allergic reactions in cats cause the following behaviors, conditions, and symptoms:

Sneezing, coughing, and wheezing

Itchy, running eyes

Ear infections

Vomiting or diarrhea

Snoring

Swollen, sensitive paws

Excessive licking (grooming)

Red or dry skin

Scratching

Types and Causes of Cat Allergies

There are 4 common allergies in cats: environmental, fleas, food, and seasonal.||One of the most common risk factors for developing chicken allergy is being exposed to chickens often or eating chicken meat too often.||Some doctors specialized in allergies and their treatment do believe that this allergy is a product of spending too much time with chickens and it is now wonder why many agriculture workers and farmers develop this allergy.||As a result, people with an egg allergy must be vigilant about reading labels and asking about the ingredients of foods prepared by others.||When recipes call for three or fewer eggs, substitute each egg with a mixture of 1 tablespoons of water, 1 tablespoons of oil and 1 teaspoon of baking powder.

The media shines a light on Vietnam veterans with PTSD

There have been recent media attempts to highlight the ongoing struggle of Vietnam veterans with PTSD.||When the authors applied these numbers to the number of veterans who served in Vietnam and are still living, they calculated that approximately 271,000 men and women are suffering from PTSD symptoms.||According to a recent study, almost 16 percent of female veterans who were stationed in Vietnam experienced post traumatic stress disorder symptoms within the past year.||According to a recent study, almost 16 percent of female veterans who were stationed in Vietnam experienced post traumatic stress disorder symptoms within the past year.||Furey has experienced PTSD symptoms on and off throughout her life since Vietnam, including depression and nightmares.||Furey has experienced PTSD symptoms on and off throughout her life since Vietnam, including depression and nightmares.||Depending on the method, the results suggest that between 4.5 percent and 11.2 percent of the male Vietnam veterans and 6.1 and 8.7 percent of the female vets are experiencing serious PTSD symptoms today.||The new study, named the National Vietnam Veterans Longitudinal Study (NVVLS), interviewed 1,450 of the original participants and found that 11 percent of the men who participated continue to show the symptoms of PTSD and 9 percent of the women met the criteria of being a Vietnam veteran with PTSD.||Among Vietnam War veterans, they estimate that 30 percent have had PTSD in their lifetime.||Around 8 percent who were stationed near Vietnam and around 9 percent who were stationed in the U.S. experienced PTSD symptoms within the past year.||Around 8 percent who were stationed near Vietnam and around 9 percent who were stationed in the U.S. experienced PTSD symptoms within the past year.||Veterans surveyed were active in Vietnam, in areas around Vietnam, and in the U.S. for at least 30 days.||Veterans surveyed were active in Vietnam, in areas around Vietnam, and in the U.S. for at least 30 days.||WEDNESDAY, July 22, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- More than a quarter-million Vietnam veterans suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms today, four decades after the war's end, a new study estimates.||Both of these studies have been important stepping stones in discovering the long-term effects of PTSD, not only in Vietnam veterans, but also in the veterans of both Gulf Wars and Afghanistan.||New research shows that four decades after the Vietnam War ended, more than 270,000 veterans who served in the war zone suffer from symptoms of PTSD, a mental health condition characterized by painful flashbacks, severe anxiety, and uncontrollable thoughts about the disturbing events they experienced.||Vietnam veterans with PTSD are a group that is not keen on sharing their problems with others.||Evans' PTSD was triggered when she visited the dedication of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall in Washington on Nov. 13, 1982.||Evans' PTSD was triggered when she visited the dedication of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall in Washington on Nov. 13, 1982.||"For some veterans, as they become older, they may become more vulnerable to experiencing PTSD symptoms or might have an increase in their symptoms as their health declines, particularly their neurological health," Marmar said.||Although the understanding and treatment of Vietnam veterans with PTSD has been a long-term process with setbacks and breakthroughs, the information gathered will help all veterans of current and future wars.||Continuing the study of PTSD

The importance of early detection and treatment to prevent the disorder from becoming a chronic problem cannot be overstated for the mental health of all veterans, not just Vietnam veterans with PTSD.||The study, published online Wednesday in JAMA Psychiatry, also found that at least one-third of those veterans exhibiting symptoms of PTSD suffer from major depression, as well.||Two related studies of the long-term effects of PTSD in Vietnam veterans have sparked debate on the mental health issues that service members have to cope with in a combat zone.||The original research, known at the National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study, included 1,632 veterans who had been deployed and 716 others who served during that era but never went to Vietnam.||By Charles R.

The original NVVRS results were published in 1988 and found that current Vietnam veterans with PTSD accounted for 15 percent of the 2.7 million Americans who served in the war.||Marmar and colleagues followed up with Vietnam veterans who participated in a long-term study starting from 1984 to 1988.||Veterans must self-disclose their symptoms to the document, and the information goes on their record.||Not everybody with PTSD will experience the same symptoms in the same way.||Even for veterans in their 70s and 80s, a combination of psychotherapy, medication, and marital and family therapy can reduce PTSD symptoms, including insomnia, anxiety and irritability, he said.||The research updates a landmark study conducted in the 1980s, when researchers found that 15% of Vietnam veterans had the disorder.||Based on that sample, researchers estimated that 31% of Vietnam veterans had suffered from PTSD at some point in their lives, but that by the late 1980s about half no longer did.||Lucas said veterans and service members filling out the survey might feel pressure not to disclose all of their symptoms.||Intrusion-related PTSD symptoms involve memories intruding into your everyday life.||The study sample used almost 1,500 of the over 2,300 National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study (NVVRS) participants.||Researchers from NYU Langone Medical Center followed up with Vietnam War veterans who had participated in a study from 1984 to 1988.||He pointed out that although rates of overall depression are very low among Vietnam veterans today, one third of those with PTSD also have major depressive disorder, compounding the mental illness.||TV footage from 9/11 triggered many memories for Vietnam veterans, says Ritchie, adding that they are at a higher risk of developing PTSD as they age and become more vulnerable.||TV footage from 9/11 triggered many memories for Vietnam veterans, says Ritchie, adding that they are at a higher risk of developing PTSD as they age and become more vulnerable.||An analysis estimated that the death rate for veterans who served in the war was roughly 17% and not statistically different than the rate for veterans who did not go to Vietnam.||For example, a veteran with PTSD symptoms might be in public and feeling anxious or overwhelmed.||However, with treatment, PTSD symptoms can become far more manageable.||Among all those with PTSD, 37 percent also had major depression, and 16 percent reported a major increase in symptoms since the earlier interview, compared to 8 percent whose symptoms had significantly decreased.||"It makes people feel more comfortable sharing personal things, like symptoms of PTSD."||To meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, you must experience the following symptoms for at least 1 month:

at least one intrusion/re-experience symptom

at least one avoidance symptom

at least two hyperarousal/reactivity symptoms

at least two cognition and mood symptoms

You don’t need a PTSD diagnosis to seek therapy and support.||To receive a PTSD diagnosis, a qualified medical professional needs to assess your symptoms.||More than 10 percent of veterans have PTSD

The National Center for PTSD estimates that between 11 percent and 20 percent of veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan have PTSD.

Atil, also Itil, was the capital of the Khazar Khaganate from the mid-8th century to the late 10th century.||It is known historically to have been situated along the Silk Road, on the northern coast of the Caspian Sea, in the Volga Delta region of modern Southern Russia.||Its precise location has long been unknown.||In 2008 a Russian archaeologist claimed to have discovered the remains of Atil in Samosdelka, a village in the Volga Delta approximately 30 km southwest of the city of Astrakhan.||This claim has since been disproven.||Name

[edit]

The historical Turkic peoples living on or near the Volga region called both the river and the Khazar capital city on the river Itil or Atil.||[1]

Modern Turkic languages have retained the historical name for the Volga.||The Volga is known as İdel ( Идел) in Tatar, as Atăl (Атӑл) in Chuvash, as Iźelin in Bashkir, as Edıl in Kazakh, and as İdil in Turkish.||The origin and meaning of the ancient Turkic form "Etil/Ertil" are uncertain.||[2]

History and description

[edit]

Atil was located along the Volga delta at the northwestern corner of the Caspian Sea.||Following the defeat of the Khazars in the Second Arab-Khazar War, Atil became the capital of Khazaria.||Ibn Khordadbeh, writing in ca.||870, names Khamlij as the capital of the Khazars.||[3] This is presumably a rendition of Turkic khaganbaligh "city of the khan" and refers to the city later (in the 10th century) named as Atil in Arab historiography.||At its height, the city was a major center of trade.||It consisted of three parts separated by the Volga.||The western part contained the administrative center of the city, with a court house and a large military garrison.||The eastern part of the city was built later and acted as the commercial center of the Atil, and had many public baths and shops.||Between them was an island on which stood the palaces of the Khazar Khagan and Bek.||The island was connected to one of the other parts of the city by a pontoon bridge.||According to Arab sources of the 10th century,[4] one half of the city was referred to as Atil, while the other was named Khazaran.||Atil was a multi-ethnic and religiously diverse city, inhabited by Jews, Christians, Muslims, Shamanists, and Pagans, many of them traders from foreign countries.||All of the religious groups had their own places of worship in the city, and there were seven judges appointed to settle disputes (two Christian, two Jewish, and two Muslim judges, with a single judge for all of the Shamanists and other Pagans).||[5] The numerous Christians of Atil were under the jurisdiction of their own bishop; the minaret of the Friday mosque of the Muslims of Atil is said to have been higher than the castle.||[6]

The city was a major trade center, and managed the Khazar slave trade, in which slaves bought for export were transported from the Khazar Khaganate to either the Black Sea slave trade in the West via the Black Sea port of Kerch, or East from the capital of Atil via the Caspian Sea to Central Asia and from there to slavery in the Abbasid Caliphate.||[7]

Svyatoslav I of Kiev sacked Atil in 968 or 969 CE.||Ibn Hawqal and al-Muqaddasi refer to Atil after 969, indicating that it may have been rebuilt.||[8] Al-Biruni (mid-11th century) reported that Atil was again in ruins,[9] and did not mention the later city of Saqsin which was built nearby, so it is possible that this new Atil was only destroyed in the middle of the 11th century.||The search for archaeological remains

[edit]

As of 2024, the archaeological remains of Atil have not been positively identified.||An accepted hypothesis is that they were washed away by the rising level of the Caspian Sea.||Samosdelka site

[edit]

Main article: Samosdelka

In September 2008, Russian archaeologists excavating in the Volga Delta fishing village of Samosdelka announced their discovery of what they claimed were the remains of Atil.||[10][11] A 2020 assessment by the Russian Geographic Society concluded that Atil had not been found in Samosdelka, and announced that new excavations were underway at another site.||[12]

Semibugry site

[edit]

The archaeological remains of a settlement from the Khazar period near the village of Semibugry (Russian: Семибугры) in the central part of the Volga Delta were discovered after Samosdelka and as of 2020 were being excavated in the hopes that the settlement was Atil.||[12] According to historian Alex Feldman, "it remains impossible to archaeologically prove" the location of Atil.||[13]

Source

Here is a way to create a table with vba (remember it will only work on Excel 2007 or higher):

Sub CreateTable() ActiveSheet.ListObjects.Add(xlSrcRange, Range("$B$1:$D$16"), , xlYes).Name = _ "Table1" 'No go in 2003 ActiveSheet.ListObjects("Table1").TableStyle = "TableStyleLight2" End Sub

Source

If you use a table (defined) , you can call table object sample

Sub DefineTable() Dim tbl As ListObject Set tbl = Sheets("Plan1").ListObjects(1) tbl.Range.Select End Sub

Otherwise is create a dynamic range using a name for example

=OFFSET(Plan1!A1;0;0;counta(Plan1!A:A);counta(Plan1!1:1))

Select a name to this range, and in your pivot define a range at =NameOfInterval

[]'s

Here's how to approach if you do not know the range size: First get the index refs of the last row / column.||Table of contents:

ChurrascoMain ingredientsMeat (beef), sausage, queijo coalho, garlic bread, pork, chicken, lamb

Churrasco (Portuguese: [ʃuˈʁasku], Spanish: [tʃuˈrasko]) is the Portuguese and Spanish name for grilled beef prominent in South American and Iberian cuisines, and in particular in Bolivia, Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina.||The term is also used in other Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries for a variety of different meat products.||[1] This serving style is called espeto corrido or rodízio, and is quite popular in Brazil, especially in southern states like Rio Grande do Sul, Paraná, and Santa Catarina.||Churrasco by country

[edit]

In Brazil, churrasco is the term for a barbecue (similar to the Argentine and Uruguayan asado) which originated in southern Brazil.||It uses a variety of meats, pork, sausage and chicken which may be cooked on a purpose-built churrasqueira, a barbecue grill, often with supports for spits or skewers.||[2] Portable churrasqueiras are similar to those used to prepare the Argentine and Uruguayan asado, with a grill support, but many Brazilian churrasqueiras do not have grills, only the skewers above the embers.||The meat may alternatively be cooked on large metal or wood skewers resting on a support or stuck into the ground and roasted with the embers of charcoal (wood may also be used, especially in the state of Rio Grande do Sul).||In Nicaragua, the first immigrant group to introduce the term for this cut of beef to the United States restaurant scene in Miami, Florida as early as the 1950s, it refers to a skirt steak prepared grilled and served with a traditional chimichurri sauce made with macerated parsley, garlic, peppers, and olive oil sauce.||In Argentina and Uruguay, a churrasco refers to any boneless cut of beef that is sliced slightly thin as a steak and grilled over hot coals or on a very hot skillet.||[3]

In the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, it always refers to skirt steak, cooked on a barbecue grill.||The chimichurri sauce is optional, since the meat is very savory with just a slight hint of sea salt that is sprinkled over the meat during cooking.||In Puerto Rico, it is also customary to replace chimichurri sauce with a guava rum sauce made with spices and 7up or Ajilimójili sauce.||In Ecuador churrasco is a staple food of the Coast Region, especially Guayaquil.||The dish's main ingredient is the grilled steak that is seasoned with chimichurri, it is served with plantains, white rice, French fries, a fried egg, and slices of avocado.||In Guatemala, churrasco is regarded as a typical dish, often eaten in familiar gatherings and festive occasions.||It is usually served topped with chirmol, a red sauce containing chopped tomatoes and onions, and accompanied by corn, guacamole, grilled potatoes, stewed black beans, rice, and tortillas.||In Chile, churrasco refers to a thin cut of steak which varies depending on the desired quality of the sandwich.||The slices are grilled and served in a -sometimes warmed-local bun (called marraqueta, or pan batido in Valparaíso), usually accompanied with tomato, avocado, and mayonnaise, in the case of a churrasco italiano.||Another popular dish, churrasco a lo pobre ("poor man's churrasco"), consists of a churrasco served with French fries, fried egg, and caramelized onions.||In Portugal, frango de churrasco with piri piri (a kind of salty roasted chicken cooked on the churrasqueira, spiced with hot red chili sauce, garlic, and paprika) is very popular.||Portuguese churrasco and chicken dishes are very popular in countries with Portuguese communities, such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, South Africa, Zimbabwe (Rhodesia) and Venezuela.||The term churrasco is also used in former Portuguese colonies; a churrasco moçambicano is a grilled meat dish from Mozambique, for instance.||In Galicia, churrasco refers almost exclusively to grilled pork or beef spare ribs.||Galicians who emigrated to America in the 20th century took with them the recipe for churrasco.||Nowadays, many Galicians of all social classes prepare a churrascada.||In the mainland United States, churrasco-style restaurants have grown in popularity since the 1990s,[4] fueled by the success of various chains, including Rodizio Grill, Texas de Brazil, Fogo de Chão, and Tucanos, as well as stand-alone Brazilian barbecue restaurants.||[5]

In the mainland United States, "Churrasco" is a registered trademark for rotisserie/grills manufactured by Hickory Industries, Inc. of Fort Lee, New Jersey.||[6]

MIL-STD-1168, a classification system for ammunition production that replaced the Ammunition Identification Code (AIC) system used during World War II.||Standards for equipment and products used by the U.S. military

A United States defense standard, often called a military standard, "MIL-STD", "MIL-SPEC", or (informally) "MilSpecs", is used to help achieve standardization objectives by the U.S. Department of Defense.||Defense standards are also used by other non-defense government organizations, technical organizations, and industry.||This article discusses definitions, history, and usage of defense standards.||Related documents, such as defense handbooks and defense specifications, are also addressed.||Strictly speaking, these documents serve different purposes.||According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), military specifications "describe the physical and/or operational characteristics of a product", while military standards "detail the processes and materials to be used to make the product."||Military handbooks, on the other hand, are primarily sources of compiled information and/or guidance.||The GAO acknowledges, however, that the terms are often used interchangeably.||MIL-STD-967 covers the content and format for defense handbooks.||MIL-STD-961 covers the content and format for defense specifications.||There are five types of defense standards: interface standards, design criteria standards, manufacturing process standards, standard practices, and test method standards.||MIL-STD-962 covers the content and format for defense standards.||For purposes of this article, "military standards" will include standards, specifications and handbooks.||There are also standard names with different letters behind ′MIL-′ like MIL-C-5040H, MIL-E-7016F or MIL-S-901.||The latter two goals (MRO and logistics) favor certain general concepts, such as interchangeability, standardization (of equipment and processes, in general), cataloging, communications, and training (to teach people what is standardized, what is at their discretion, and the details of the standards).||In the late 18th century and throughout the 19th, the American and French militaries were early adopters and longtime developmental sponsors and advocates of interchangeability and standardization.||By World War II (1939–1945), virtually all national militaries and trans-national alliances of the same (Allied Forces, Axis powers) were busy standardizing and cataloguing.||The U.S. AN- cataloguing system (Army-Navy) and the British Defence Standards (DEF-STAN) provide examples.||For example, due to differences in dimensional tolerances, in World War II American screws, bolts, and nuts did not fit British equipment properly and were not fully interchangeable.||[6] Defense standards provide many benefits, such as minimizing the number of types of ammunition, ensuring compatibility of tools, and ensuring quality during production of military equipment.||This results, for example, in ammunition and food cases that can be opened without tools; vehicle subsystems that can be quickly swapped into the place of damaged ones; and small arms and artillery that are less likely to find themselves with an excess of ammunition that does not fit and a lack of ammo that does.||However, the proliferation of standards also has some drawbacks.||The main one is that they impose what is functionally equivalent to a regulatory burden upon the defense supply chain, both within the military and across its civilian suppliers.||Responding to increasing criticism, Secretary of Defense William J. Perry issued a memorandum in 1994 that prohibited the use of most military specifications and standards without a waiver.||[7] This has become known as the "Perry Memorandum".||[8] Many military specifications and standards were canceled.||"Performance specifications" describe the desired performance of the weapon, rather than describing how those goals would be reached (that is, directing which technology or which materials would be used).||The 2005 memo did not reinstate any canceled military specifications or standards.||According to a 2003 issue of Gateway, published by the Human Systems Information Analysis Center,[10] the number of defense standards and specifications have been reduced from 45,500 to 28,300.||However, other sources noted that the number of standards just before the Perry Memorandum was issued was less than 30,000, and that thousands have been canceled since then.||This may be due to differences in what is counted as a "military standard".||Another potential drawback of thorough standardization is a threat analogous to monoculture (where lack of biodiversity creates higher risk of pandemic disease) or a ship without bulkhead compartmentalization (where even a small hull leak threatens the whole vessel).||If an enemy discovers a drawback in a standardized system, the system's uniformity leaves it vulnerable to complete incapacitation via what might otherwise have been a limited compromise.

Acoustic Neuroma Symptoms

The early symptoms of an acoustic neuroma are often subtle.||There are multiple types of causes of tail trauma in dogs.||Schwannoma in Dogs

Schwannomas are tumors that originate in the myelin sheath.||Because many of these examples of tail trauma in dogs can be painful, your veterinary professional may recommend either medications or steps to reduce the discomfort your pet is experiencing.||The vet took a look at his tail & believes it may be a neuroma from when his tail was docked.||His tail has a large scar on it where it was docked and the vet told us that sometimes breeders don't stitch the wound when they dock tails and the scar tissue can form around the nerve in the tail causing a neuroma.||Acoustic Neuroma Treatments

There are three main courses of treatment for acoustic neuroma:

Observation

Surgery

Radiation therapy

Observation is also called watchful waiting.||For some tail injuries, surgical intervention may be required, for example, amputation of some portion of the tail in the case of a severe injury, fracture or dislocation of the tail.||Blood work may also be necessary because some health conditions not associated with trauma can also demonstrate symptoms similar to some of those noted above for tail trauma.||Acoustic Neuroma Causes

There are two types of acoustic neuroma: a sporadic form and a form associated with a syndrome called neurofibromatosis type II (NF2).||You will need to provide a thorough history of your dog's health leading up to the onset of symptoms.||One known risk factor for acoustic neuroma is exposure to high doses of radiation, especially to the head and neck.||Many people attribute the symptoms to normal changes of aging, so it may be a while before the condition is diagnosed.||An acoustic neuroma is a noncancerous growth that develops on the eighth cranial nerve.||Symptoms like clumsiness and mental confusion can signal a serious problem that requires urgent treatment.||If you suspect a tail trauma in your dog, you should call your veterinary professional right away.||I talked to my breeder about it, and she said it could be "phantom tail" in that a nerve ending could be tucked up in there, rubbing against the bone of where she was docked and just "bite" from time to time.||The first symptom is usually a gradual loss of hearing in one ear, often accompanied by ringing in the ear (tinnitus) or a feeling of fullness in the ear.||Radiation therapy for this condition is usually delivered in one of two ways:

Single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), in which many hundreds of small beams of radiation are aimed at the tumor in a single session.||There are three main surgical approaches for removing an acoustic neuroma:

Translabyrinthine, which involves making an incision behind the ear and removing the bone behind the ear and some of the middle ear.||Often doctors monitor the tumor with periodic MRI scans and will suggest other treatment if the tumor grows a lot or causes serious symptoms.||However, when that spastic tail isn’t wagging, we owners should view that as a signal that something is amiss in our beloved family member.||If any of you remember Leah (aka Emily) her tail is completely gone.||Other symptoms, which may occur over time, include:

Problems with balance

Vertigo (feeling like the world is spinning)

Facial numbness and tingling, which may be constant or come and go

Facial weakness

Taste changes

Difficulty swallowing and hoarseness

Headaches

Clumsiness or unsteadiness

Confusion

It's important to see your doctor if you experience these symptoms.||Tail trauma is defined as basically any injury to the canine tail or its supporting structures.||The downside of this technique is that it results in permanent hearing loss.||Everyone knows that a wagging tail on a dog is a means of communication -- usually a positive thing.||NF2 is an inherited disorder characterized by the growth of noncancerous tumors in the nervous system.||Symptoms and Types

Chronic, progressive forelimb lameness and muscle atrophy

Lameness in the hind limbs

Peripheral nerve disorder (from self-mutilation)

Palpable mass (mass can be felt by touch examination)

Horner's syndrome, a disease of the sympathetic nervous system: automatic nerve reaction, affects parts of the body not under direct control

If the Schwannoma is in the neck, only one side of the face will be affected:

Droopy eyelid

One sided facial paralysis

Decreased pupil size

Slight elevation of the lower eyelid

Causes

Idiopathic (unknown)

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your dog, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel.||Acoustic neuromas are the most common of these tumors and often occur in both ears by age 30.||My dobe had his tail redone at almost 2yrs.||If anyone has experienced this type of behavior or knows anything about "phantom tail," I would love to hear about it.||Recovery of your beloved canine family member will be dependent upon the cause of the trauma in addition to the severity of the injury and the resulting damage, whether permanent or temporary.||Well, we finally decided to have Razor's tail re-docked.||Here is a brief explanation of those causes:

Self-inflicted wounds - These would be the biting, chewing and licking behaviors in which your canine involves himself for various reasons like allergies, fleas and other parasitic bites, dry and itchy skin conditions, painful abrasions or ulcers

Vehicular mishaps - These include conflicts with cars, bicycles and other motor vehicles (these causes can result in serious hip and spine injury, and even death)

“Family” inflicted - These would include the well meaning tugs that children tend to do with the family dog, the injury received when grandma’s rocking chair is too close, or the injuries received when that tail gets caught in the car or bedroom door when it’s being closed

These are just a few examples of tail traumas which can afflict your canine family member.||Several times a day he lets out a yelp & runs to mom for a tail rubbin', or he runs to his bed to hide & chew on his tail.||Keep you fingers & paws crossed that this surgery fixes his tail pain.||Injuries near the base of the tail are the most serious as they can affect how the dog evacuates his bowels and bladder as well as gait and general movement.||I thought it was weird and she does have a scar on her tail.||He sometimes acts like he just got stung on the tail & runs & hides.||His tail is a bit on the long side, so there is room to re-dock.||Radiation therapy is recommended in some cases for acoustic neuromas.||Close observation and rest, along with a healthy diet and plenty of clean fresh water in a safe environment are common sense steps that you can expect to be part of the treatment plan recommended by your vet.||I would say have it done if he is in pain.||Interesting....Cliffy does this every once in a while too.||Any time a canine’s tail appears to be injured, a veterinary visit is warranted without delay.||If your Vet is confident that Razor's tail can be fixed, I would say go for it.||This behavior change can signal injury as well as illness in your dog.||I hope this fixes his problem, nothing worse than seeing our pups in pain.||We had our Vet take a look, but there really wasn't anything they could do, his tail was cut quite short.

===========================
It makes sense to maximize this space by determining how many rows you can best fit in the drawer and how wide each rectangle should be to make that happen.||I fold accordingly.||Then I looked at YouTube and found videos of KonMari and similar ones by other neatnicks, who can fold like precision assembly machines, some of whom seem to enjoy arranging t-shirts compulsively by color gradient.||Peruse YouTube at your own risk for folding fetish videos:

One helpful refinement I’ve discovered is to fold as to make the item more identifiable in the drawer.||And KonMari’s discussion of socks just plain confused me.||Here’s a short, straightforward video showing KonMari folding a shirt.||Or you can fold a garment so the neck hole or waist band is facing up, so you can see the tags or logos inside.||Welcome back to the continuing saga of our de-cluttering initiative, inspired by The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up, by the tidying consultant Marie Kondo (aka KonMari–her method is called the KonMari Method).||You can fold t-shirts so their design ends up on the upper edge of the rectangle, for instance, so you can tell one shirt from another.||I’m still not sure what KonMari is on about with the socks, but I get that it’s not good to stretch the cuff of one sock over the top of another–it stretches the elastic over time, leading to a bad case of floppy sock.||KonMari is big into the standing up thing, but since clothes rarely have to stand on their own (say, if you empty your drawer of all but one shirt) it really doesn’t matter.||Very simply, KonMari politely insists (while flicking her pink glitter cat o’ nine tails) that we shape our all of our foldables into neat rectangular packets and stand them cheek-by-jowl in our drawers, rather like file folders in a standing file.||You will just have to imagine it.||All your foldables, from jeans to underwear, just need to be folded into vaguely rectangular packets by whatever method you think best.||That’s all you really have to know.||I tried to take a picture for you all, but it’s impossible to photograph a black cat sleeping on black pants in a dark hole.||Today I’m just going to focus on folding clothes.||This is especially true when your drawers are overcrowded to begin with.||I’ve discovered that this technique applies to panties and bras and socks, too.||You can try to be careful– heaven knows I’ve tried–but eventually the stacks topple and chaos ensues.||My underwear drawer used to be the most chaotic of all drawers, and now everything exists in sushi-like tidyness.||All you have to think about is the width of the drawer or the shoe box or whatever space you are using.||They’d have to be made out of paper so I could burn them at the end of each day.)||This may seem a little extreme, but this simple change in behavior seems to be making all the difference in our dresser drawers.||However, unless you have a vast plentitude of drawer space you will need to thin down your wardrobe before doing this, because you can’t cram the drawers full anymore.||You can fit more stuff in a drawer by stacking vertically, certainly, but it’s hard to keep the drawers tidy, because you’re always rooting through the stacks looking for things.||As someone who has always folded clothes into squarish shapes and stacked these squares vertically in drawers, this small change has made a lot of difference for me.||When clothes are lined up vertically, like file folders, you can find what you’re looking for at a glance, and remove it without disturbing the other garments.||Your drawers remain tidy.||For a simpleminded soul like me, who never thought of this before, it’s a miracle.||Drawer tidying–reasserting the stacks–was always one of my least favorite household chores.||I’d let it go for a long time, and live by shamefully rooting through my tangled clothing each day, searching for a certain camisole like a truffle pig rooting through oak leaves.||All my small things are now folded into squarish packets and arranged in two shoe boxes.||It works amazingly well.||I am not sharing an image of this with the Internet.||It’s pretty simple.||Two shoe boxes, one holding socks, the other holding bras, panties and hankies.||Two rows in each box.||Let me stop here and talk about the folding itself.||When I first read about the folding in Tidying Up, it sounded complicated, in fact, it sounded suspiciously like origami, which I was always bad at.||But here’s the deal.||It’s not hard.||Don’t be intimidated by the precision folding.||Fatter shapes are better, because fat bundles stand up better on their own.||Does that make sense?||Our drawers are quite narrow, so they hold two rows of t-shirts.||Her creases are scarily precise–just ignore that–but the overall technique is understandable, even for the slobby.||That shape she ends up with is the kind of shape you’re going for.||My underwear is folded into rough squares, as I said above.||That just worked better with their shape and the dimensions of the shoe box.

Cuttings for Indoors:

Giant Zinnias have long stalks for flower vases and other arrangements.||For miniatures, use a small container or vase and cut stem a couple inches long.||How to Grow Zinnia Plants:

Grow Zinnia plants in full sun.||There is a profusion of colors, multi-colors, and hues.||Zinnias prefer dry conditions, but supplemental watering is necessary in times of drought.||How to Grow Zinnia Flowers

Annual

Zinnias are a one of the gardening world's most popular and versatile flowers.||Improve appearance of Giant Zinnias by trimming back stems that have grown long or gangly, but do not over trim them.||Wait until the soil is completely dry, water the soil thoroughly at ground level, apply the fertilizer and then water again to distribute the nutrients and prevent injury to the roots.||Bunch up a variety of colors for an eye-appealing arrangement.||Add mulch around the plants for appearance and to keep weeds down.||Transplant Zinnias into your garden after the last frost date for your area.||Use a balanced flower fertilizer according to the manufacturer's instructions for proper dosage.||Space plantings 12 to 24 inches apart to allow room for growth and to promote air circulation.||Zinnia seeds can be directly seeded into your flower garden, or started indoors, for transplanting later.||Cut the stem low, check for insects hiding in the flower, on the stem and under the leaves.||Choose a planting location for zinnia plants that receives at least 6 hours of full sun per day and has fertile, well-drained soil.||There are miniature and giant varieties ranging in size, from about a foot for miniatures, to giant varieties that can grow over three to four feet tall.||Cut zinnias back for fresh flower arrangements if desired, as this has the same effect as deadheading and will encourage the plants to continue flowering while allowing you to enjoy their beauty indoors.||Zinnias are warm weather flowers and perform best in hot, dry locations.||Prepare the site by incorporating 1 to 2 inches of organic compost into the soil with a garden tiller prior to planting.||Sow seeds directly in the garden in spring after all threat of frost has passed.||Taller varieties of zinnias need at least 24 inches in between plantings, but dwarf varieties are fine with 12 inches in between.||Water zinnia plants immediately after planting and at least once per week until growth emerges.||Reduce watering to once every two weeks after plants become established, but only when there has been no natural rainfall.||Feed zinnias once per month during the spring and summer, beginning in the second month of growth.||Remove spent zinnia flowers after they begin to fade, to promote additional blooms.||Pinch them off as close to the stem as possible using your fingers, or cut them back with pruning shears.||Native to Mexico, there are many varieties, big and small.||Zinnia are members of the Daisy family, and are easy to grow.||Profusely blooming plants, come in a wide range of colors.||Flowers will bloom from mid-summer all the way until frost.||Colors include, white, yellow, orange, red, rose, pink and multi-colored blooms.||Larger varieties look good at the back of the flower garden.||Dwarf varieties fit well as borders, edging, or planted in mass.||Try the smaller varieties in a windowsill planter, or in containers on your patio or deck.||See: Popular Zinnia varieties

Zinnia make good cut flowers.||Plant Propagation:

Zinnias are grown from seed.||Start seedling indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost in your area.||Zinnias like rich, well drained soil, but are somewhat tolerant of average to slightly poor soils.||Mix in plenty of compost prior to planting.||Add a general purpose fertilizer at planting time, and once a month during the growing season.||Sow Zinnia seeds early in the season and cover lightly with soil.||Water thoroughly once.||They germinate easily, and will grow quickly, producing their first of a continual display of blooms by mid-summer.||Spacing depends upon size with miniature varieties spaced four to six inches apart, and Giant varieties one to two feet apart.||Once your Zinnia plants are established, they should grow well.||Soil should be moist, but not wet.||Water them during dry periods, once or twice per week.||Remove dead flower blooms to encourage new growth and new blooms.||Bring them indoors and place in water immediately.

Non-drug therapies can also alleviate some symptoms of dementia.||That's why memory loss is often one of the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer's.||Worldwide, while older women w ith symptoms of depression tend to be the most frequent recipients of ECT in western countries, younger men with schizophrenia make up the group most often receiving this therapy in Asian countries.||ECT often is effective in cases where antidepressant medications and psychotherapy do not provide sufficient relief of symptoms.||Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a non-medication medical treatment that addresses severe psychiatric symptoms, after trials of medications and psychotherapy have been unsuccessful or a mental health disorder is determined to be severe and acute enough to warrant this intervention.||But it's harder to determine the exact type of dementia because the symptoms and brain changes of different dementias can overlap.||Appreciation of the effectiveness of ECT started regaining ground in psychiatry during the mid-1980s with the publication of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Conference on Electroconvulsive Therapy, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), which documented how well this medical treatment improves symptoms of depression.||Others can temporarily slow the worsening of dementia symptoms and improve quality of life for those living with Alzheimer's and their caregivers.||The same medications used to treat Alzheimer's are among the drugs sometimes prescribed to help with symptoms of other types of dementias.||Overview

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a common type of talk therapy (psychotherapy).||Length of therapy

CBT is generally considered short-term therapy — ranging from about five to 20 sessions.||These may include such issues as a medical condition, divorce, grief, anger or symptoms of a mental health disorder.||Ask whether the therapist has expertise and experience treating your symptoms or your area of concern, such as eating disorders or PTSD.||Formerly called electroshock therapy or shock therapy, ECT is a form of mental health therapy that can be a life-saving treatment for people with some severe mental illnesses.||The effectiveness of this medical treatment has been shown for the depressive symptoms of both major depressive (unipolar) and manic -depressive (bipolar) disorders.||Symptoms and signs of cognitive impairment and dementia

An early stage of memory loss or other cognitive ability loss is called mild cognitive impairment (MCI).||What types of health care professionals administer electroconvulsive therapy?||It's an overall term to describe a collection of symptoms that one may experience if they are living with a variety of diseases, including Alzheimer's disease.||Dementia symptoms are progressive, which means that the signs of cognitive impairment start out slowly and gradually get worse over time, leading to dementia.||Short-term memory loss and confusion are side effects of electroconvulsive therapy.||Factors to consider include:

Type of disorder or situation

Severity of your symptoms

How long you've had your symptoms or have been dealing with your situation

How quickly you make progress

How much stress you're experiencing

How much support you receive from family members and other people

Confidentiality

Except in very specific circumstances, conversations with your therapist are confidential.||Behavior Research and Therapy.||Some health plans cover only a certain number of therapy sessions a year.||There are many other conditions that can cause symptoms of cognitive impairment but that aren't dementia, including some that are reversible, such as thyroid problems and vitamin deficiencies.||Approach therapy as a partnership.||What is cognitive behavioral therapy?||Why is electroconvulsive therapy controversial?||Dementia symptoms trigger a decline in thinking skills, also known as cognitive abilities, severe enough to impair daily life and independent function.||Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).||Why do physicians perform electroconvulsive therapy?||Why it's done

Cognitive behavioral therapy is used to treat a wide range of issues.||What is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)?||How do doctors perform electroconvulsive therapy today?||It generally requires fewer sessions than other types of therapy and is done in a structured way.||But you can take steps to get the most out of your therapy and help make it a success.||For example, it may help you:

Manage symptoms of mental illness

Prevent a relapse of mental illness symptoms

Treat a mental illness when medications aren't a good option

Learn techniques for coping with stressful life situations

Identify ways to manage emotions

Resolve relationship conflicts and learn better ways to communicate

Cope with grief or loss

Overcome emotional trauma related to abuse or violence

Cope with a medical illness

Manage chronic physical symptoms

Mental health disorders that may improve with CBT include:

Depression

Anxiety disorders

Phobias

PTSD

Sleep disorders

Eating disorders

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)

Substance use disorders

Bipolar disorders

Schizophrenia

Sexual disorders

In some cases, CBT is most effective when it's combined with other treatments, such as antidepressants or other medications.||The key is to find a skilled therapist who can match the type and intensity of therapy with your needs.||If therapy isn't helping, talk to your therapist.||Make sure you understand:

His or her approach

What type of therapy is appropriate for you

The goals of your treatment

The length of each session

How many therapy sessions you may need

It might take a few sessions for your therapist to fully understand your situation and concerns, and to determine the best course of action.||And even if symptoms suggest dementia, early diagnosis allows a person to get the maximum benefit from available treatments and provides an opportunity to volunteer for clinical trials or studies.||Or a doctor or someone else may suggest therapy to you.||It's not uncommon to feel worse during the initial part of therapy as you begin to confront past and current conflicts.||If your therapist asks you to read, keep a journal or do other activities outside of your regular therapy sessions, follow through.||Physicians often consider if a treatment known as magnetic stimulation therapy is ineffective.||Some forms of CBT, such as exposure therapy, may require you to confront situations you'd rather avoid — such as airplanes if you have a fear of flying.||Therapy is most effective when you're an active participant and share in decision-making.||A person usually needs six to 12 treatments for this medical therapy to be effective.||Success with therapy depends on your willingness to share your thoughts, feelings and experiences, and on being open to new insights and ways of doing things.||If you feel down or lack motivation, it may be tempting to skip therapy sessions.||Doing these homework assignments will help you apply what you've learned in the therapy sessions.

Signs and symptoms

[edit]

In women, high blood levels of prolactin are typically associated with hypoestrogenism, anovulatory infertility, and changes in menstruation.||[11]

Men often present late in the course of hyperprolactinemia, typically symptoms are related to the expansion of their pituitary tumor, such as headaches, visual defects, and external opthalmoplegia, or symptoms from secondary adrenal or thyroid failure.||Individuals with hyperprolactinemia may present with symptoms including galactorrhea, hypogonadism effects, and/or infertility.||However, data in patients with Parkinson's Disease who have taken much larger doses of cabergoline than the typical prolactinoma patient has raised concern about possible heart valve effects, and safety during pregnancy has not been established.||Symptoms of prolactinoma are caused by the pressure of the tumor on surrounding tissues or by excessive release of prolactin from the tumor into the blood (causing a condition known as hyperprolactinemia).||Symptoms of prolactinoma are caused by the pressure of the tumor on surrounding tissues or by excessive release of prolactin from the tumor into the blood (causing a condition known as hyperprolactinemia).||For patients taking cabergoline, a switch to bromocriptine is generally advised because of the much greater amount of safety data in pregnancy that is availableAs soon as a patient is pregnant, her doctor will usually advise that she stop taking bromocriptine.||The patient should consult her endocrinologist promptly if she develops symptoms, particularly headaches, or visual changes.||A decrease in estrogen can cause premenopausal women to experience menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness.||The most common symptoms of high prolactin levels include:

Vision Impairment and Headache

Pituitary tumors can causecompression on the surrounding tissue near the pituitary gland (located at the middle of the head, just below the brain).||This can result in signs and symptoms such as headaches and changes in vision in pregnant females who have large prolactinomas.||Since the pituitary is in such a tight space, any abnormal growth can result in signs and symptoms secondary to compression of the gland.||Since the pituitary is in such a tight space, any abnormal growth can result in signs and symptoms secondary to compression of the gland.||[2]

In men, the most common symptoms of hyperprolactinemia are decreased libido, sexual dysfunction, erectile dysfunction/impotence, infertility, and gynecomastia.||[11] As a result, the early signs of hyperprolactinemia are generally more difficult to detect and may go unnoticed until more severe symptoms are present.||[11] For instance, symptoms such as loss of libido and sexual dysfunction are subtle, arise gradually, and may falsely indicate a different cause.||Hypothyroidism Symptoms, Such As Fatigue, Low Libido, Weakness

The production of hormones that stimulate the thyroid gland and adrenal gland is affected because of the pressure in the pituitary gland.||Both surgery and radiation therapy may be used to treat prolactinomas when the symptoms cannot be controlled or the tumor does not shrink enough with medications.||Females who are postmenopausal are more likely to notice signs and symptoms later, when tumors are larger and more likely to cause headache or vision problems.||Both surgery and radiation therapy may be used to treat prolactinomas when the symptoms cannot be controlled or the tumor does not shrink enough with medications.||When to see a doctor

Apple Cider Vinegar Benefits

Kidney stones are a major risk factor for chronic kidney disease.||Apple cider vinegar is sometimes used to help with kidney stones.||One major ingredient in apple cider vinegar is potassium, which is known to be essential for the growth of the body and replacement of older tissues.||As its name suggests, apple cider vinegar is produced from fermented apple juice, so it falls into this category.||However, using apple cider vinegar for kidney stones is a hit or miss.||Some people with ongoing renal issues use apple cider vinegar as a regular dietary supplement.||Advertisement

Apple cider vinegar is said to dissolve kidney stones and make them easier to pass.||Many people use apple cider vinegar as a form of alternative medicine to help with many different types of health ailments.||Natural remedies, such as dandelion tea, ginger and apple cider vinegar (ACV), are prized for their healing power.||Made from fermented ripe apples, apple cider vinegar contains many vitamins, potassium, sodium, magnesium, beta-carotene, calcium, pectin, iron and malic acid.||If the taste of the vinegar is too intense, add honey to the drink.||The theory behind it is that the acids in the vinegar can soften or dissolve kidney stones in order to break them up.||The best thing you can do is to prevent it in the first place.||The vinegar can act as a purifier to break down fatty deposits in the body and help prevent urine from being too alkaline.||Advertisement

Kidney disease can result from a variety of causes, from high blood pressure to recurrent kidney infections.||Most stones result from calcium buildup in the body, excessive uric acid or high cystine levels, according to Harvard Health Publishing.||The National Kidney Foundation recommends drinking plenty of water and avoiding hot yoga, intense exercise and other activities that promote fluid loss.||Traditionally, ACV is mixed with water or lemon water and cranberry juice, then consumed several times a day to dissolve the stones.||For example, a large-scale study published in ​BJU International​ in February 2017 suggests that fermented vinegar may reduce the formation of kidney stones.||Malic acid is known to fight bacterial and fungal infections as well as dissolve uric acid, which are the roots of many major kidney issues and problems such as toxin buildup, chronic renal failure, kidney stones and pyelitis.||This food ingredient has emerged as a natural remedy for kidney stones, liver disease, high cholesterol and diabetes.||Although it's not a cure-all, it may improve kidney health and prevent stone formation.||Most symptoms are nonspecific and occur in late stages when treatment options are limited.||Sufferers may experience difficulty sleeping, fatigue and low energy, dry skin, poor appetite and muscle cramps.||Smokers, olders adults and people living with obesity are at greater risk.||Genetics and certain disorders, such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes, may increase your risk, too.||This so-called superfood is widely used for kidney cleansing, liver detox, weight loss and everything in between.||Although it's likely safe when used in moderation, its health benefits are controversial.||Fever, chills and cloudy or bloody urine are common symptoms.||Furthermore, anecdotal evidence suggests that it may prevent this condition and improve kidney function.||Cranberry juice has no proven benefits for kidney function, though.||Lemons and their juice are high in citrate, a naturally occurring acid that may prevent stone formation and suppress kidney stone growth.

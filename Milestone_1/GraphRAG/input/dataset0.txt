The essay starts out with the statement “The history of life on earth has been an interaction between living things and their surroundings” (Carson, pg. 57). On the other hand, it closes with “The obligation to endure gives us the right to know” (Carson, pg. 6). These are good statements that give the reader an idea of what can be expected.

The Obligation to Endure by Rachel Carson Rachel Carson's essay on The Obligation to Endure, is a very convincing argument about the harmful uses of chemicals, pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers on the environment. Carson believes that as man tries to eliminate unwanted insects and weeds, however he is actually causing more problems by polluting the environment with, for example, DDT and harming living things. Carson adds that the intensification of agriculture is causing other major problems, like newly developed or created insects and diseases. “The Obligation to Endure” from Silent Springby Rachel Carson.

Progressive Era. The Progressive Era was a period of widespread social activism and political reform across the United States, from the 1890s to the 1920s.[1] The main objectives of the Progressive movement were eliminating problems caused by industrialization, urbanization, immigration, and corruption in government. As a result, the concept of reform took place in society. Reformers such as social workers, journalists, educators and even politicians emerged to change society. This was known as the Progressive Movement. One issue was consistently ignored: the plight of African-Americans in the United States. African-Americans were faced with consistent racism in the form of segregation in public spaces and disenfranchisement from the political process. The ratification of the 19th amendment in 1920, which recognized women's suffrage was last amendment during the progressive era. Another significant constitutional change that began during the progressive era was the incorporation of the Bill of Rights so that those rights would apply to the states. Progressive Era.

passage_text: On an average day, forensic chemists apply knowledge from diverse disciplines such as chemistry, biology, materials science, and genetics to analyze evidence found at crime scenes or in the bodies of crime suspects. Forensic chemists often don’t know the nature of the sample before they analyze it. Neither do forensic scientists spend their time at crime scenes looking for clues – a job done by the Socos, who, Sheridan explains, are police officers primarily involved in “visiting crime scenes, looking for any evidential links and collecting and correctly packaging any worthy exhibits”. The Truth About This Occupation. 1  Forensic science technicians work around the clock. Expect your shifts to include days, evenings, overnights, weekends, and holidays. 2  Many people find investigating the aftermath of violent crimes upsetting. 3  You may have to work overtime or be on-call to collect evidence. Some decide that forensic science is not for them, particularly after the experience of the courtroom training sessions, and successfully find employment in industrial analytical and research laboratories or study for higher degrees. Forensic Scientists do not attend crime scenes (except for firearms examiners, who are often also police officers do attend scenes as do members of the lab who analyze explosives and clandestine labs) but receive the evidence from the Ident officers and then analyze the evidence and submit a report giving their opinion of the weight of the evidence. In laboratories, a forensic science technician will typically do the following: Identify and classify crime scene evidence through scientific analysis Explore possible links between suspects and criminal activity using the results of chemical and physical analyses A:In order to become a forensic scientist, you will need an education in forensic sciences. If you are just looking for an entry level in the criminal justice sector, you can go for a 6 month certificate or diploma. A 4 year bachelor's degree can also get you entry-level positions with forensic departments. Why is forensic science important. Rapid growth of poverty, economic recession of global economy, and the unjust behavior of humanity have become the contributing factors that led to increasing criminal activities. These have triggered to the continuous waste of lives of innocent people and this is where the discipline of forensic science comes in. Some forensic scientists perform a wide array of lab work. Other forensic scientists specialize in certain aspects of crimes. There are a couple of required skills that all forensic scientists need. A forensic scientist must have good communication skills for writing reports that will be read by other scientists and laymen. Many of these scientists are called on to give expert witness testimony or present evidence in court and need good public speaking skills. Forensic science technicians typically need at least a bachelor’s degree in a natural science, such as chemistry or biology, or in forensic science. On-the-job training is usually required both for those who investigate crime scenes and for those who work in labs.

passage_text: A: Very, very rarely. They are a strictly nocturnal species by nature, and those seen in the day have usually been flushed from the roost site, and are not hunting. Those seen hunting during the day are probably starving. Q: Where do the owls go to hunt at night? A: In most cases, these birds travel 1 to 2 miles from the daytime roost site to hunt. They hunt in roadside ditches, grassy fields, meadows, and swampy areas away from buildings. Q: How many voles does an owlet eat each night? A: For the first two weeks of age they eat from 2 to 4 per night. At three to five weeks of age they will consume 5 to 10 per night, per owlet! Owls are carnivorous and will eat rodents, small or medium sized mammals, nocturnal insects, fish and other birds, including smaller owls. After digesting their food, owls regurgitate hard pellets of compressed bones, fur, teeth, feathers and other materials they couldn't digest. It was the day Knapp Forest Elementary first-graders knew was coming: the day teacher Lana Tran would have them put on their scientist caps -- in this case, in the homemade form of birds -- and dissect owl pellets. That's a ball that an owl throws up that has bones and feathers and all the stuff he can't digest, Gabe explained when called on. Quick Answer. Snowy owls eat mammals, such as rabbits and rodents, and other birds. The snowy owl swallows its prey whole when it eats and hunts during the day. Snowy owls are nomadic, meaning that they follow their prey and choose living locations based on the movement of the prey. Owls do not build nests; rather they just take over abandoned nests. While they usually lay between 3-4 eggs, a female owl can lay up to 13 eggs in the breeding season, depending on the species. Incubation will last 30 days after which the chicks hatch. Like most owls, the barn owl is nocturnal, relying on its acute sense of hearing when hunting in complete darkness. It often becomes active shortly before dusk and can sometimes be seen during the day when relocating from one roosting site to another. Q: If I put up a nest box and Barn Owls use it, should I look in periodically to count eggs and such? A: If you do, make sure both adults are not in the box. If you disturb an adult with young during the day, they may harm the owlets. If you plan to count eggs or young at a nest site, wait in a secluded and quiet area within view of the box or nest site until you see both adults leave the nest for nightly hunting. We live in a very rural area with LOTs of Great Horned Owls, a nesting pair of Redtails & TWO nesting pairs of eagles (one pair of Goldens & one pair of Balds) within a couple of miles of my house I've never had any troubles with my poultry out during the day & predation by air. Owls are birds of prey or raptors. A raptor is a bird that has a sharp beak and sharp claws or talons that it uses to catch and eat its food. Check out our Science Trek Birds of Prey website for more information! Members of the raptor group include hawks, eagles, falcons and owls. The barn owl is the most widely distributed species of owl and one of the most widespread of all birds. It is also referred to as the common barn owl, to distinguish it from other species in its family, Tytonidae, which forms one of the two main lineages of living owls, the other being the typical owls. The barn owl is found almost everywhere in the world except polar and desert regions, Asia north of the Himalayas, most of Indonesia, and some Pacific islands. Phylogenetic evidence shows that th

passage_text: Lightning is a major cause of storm related deaths in the U.S. A lightning strike can result in a cardiac arrest (heart stopping) at the time of the injury, although some victims may appear to have a delayed death a few days later if they are resuscitated but have suffered irreversible brain damage. Quick Answer. Lightning strikes reach the ground on Earth as much as 8 million times per day or 100 times per second, according to the National Severe Storms Laboratory. Out of all the lightning strikes in the world, the United States accounts for about 20 million of the total number of lightning strikes each year. Keep Learning. An average lightning strike discharges about 30,000 amperes (20,000 amperes in the UK). The current in a lightning strike typically ranges from 5,000 to 50,000 amperes depending on the strength of storm. NASA has recorded strikes of 100,000 amperes and there are other reports of strikes over 200,000 amperes. Lightning fatalities in the U.S.: A map of total lightning fatalities in the United States between 1959 and 2013. With 471 deaths, Florida has more than double the number of fatalities of any other state. Lightning is a sudden high-voltage discharge of electricity that occurs within a cloud, between clouds, or between a cloud and the ground. Globally, there are about 40 to 50 flashes of lightning every second, or nearly 1.4 billion flashes per year. Although many lightning flashes are simply cloud-to-cloud, there are as many as 9,000,000 reported lightning strikes that damage buildings, trees, and other objects every year. Worldwide, it is estimated that of an annual 1.4 billion lightning bolts, 25% (more than 350 million) will strike the Earth's surface or objects on the surface. The vast majority of these strikes, however, occur in the tropics, and in unpopulated areas. 100 times per second; Lightning can strike over a thousand times in one storm. So, lightning strikes the earth over a million times a day. Globally, 8,640,000 lightning strikes per day. According to the NWS Storm Data, over the last 30 years (1986-2015) the U.S. has averaged 48 reported lightning fatalities per year. Only about 10% of people who are struck by lightning are killed, leaving 90% with various degrees of disability. More recently, in the last 10 years (2006-2015), the U.S. has averaged 31 lightning fatalities. Approximately 300,000 lightning strikes hit the ground in Britain each year with 30 percent of reported lightning strikes causing severe damage. Each year 30 to 60 people are recorded as being struck by lightning, 3 of whom, on average, die (14 in 1984 compared to 2 in 2005). Florida is also the state with the highest number of deaths from lightning strikes. Other states along the Gulf of Mexico coast, such as Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, also have frequent lightning. Along the Atlantic coast, North Carolina and South Carolina have frequent lightning. There is estimated to be around 2,000 lightning storm active around the global at one time creating over 100 strikes per second. These thunderstorms generate a potential difference of 200,000 to 500,000 volts between the Earth’s surface and the ionosphere, with a fair weather current of about 2×10-12 amperes/meter2.

passage_text: Verify the reason for the lawn burn. Grass will turn yellow due to an over application of high nitrogen fertilizer. The lawn will also turn yellow when it goes dormant in the fall. Rake the lawn to remove as much dead grass as possible. Remove several inches of soil if the herbicide was not a high nitrogen type. These spots are generally caused by a buildup of nitrogen in the soil. Although nitrogen is required to make the lawn green, a lawn burn is a case of too much of a good thing. The nitrogen buildup may be caused by over-fertilizing your lawn, or it may be caused by urine deposits left by pets. No matter what the source of nitrogen burn marks, fixing the discolored lawn is relatively easy. Position the sprinkler over the portion of overfertilized lawn. Turn on the sprinkler and allow it to run until the soil below the grass becomes fully saturated. Allow the water to drain down through the soil, carrying the excess fertilizer with it. Apply 1 inch of water per day for the next seven days. When fertilizing start with a dry lawn. Using either a broadcast or drop spreader, apply one-half of the recommended amount in one direction then spread the remaining half at right angles to the first. After fertilizing, it is necessary to water your lawn to wash the material off the grass and into the soil. Fertilizing Tips. Watering and mowing alone will not make a healthy lawn. It must be fertilized. We have included a starter fertilizer in the mixture applied, but it is only sufficient to supply enough nutrients for about 30 to 45 days. It is important for the development of a healthy lawn that a fertilization program be started at this time. A yellow burned lawn is an eye sore that can only be fixed by reseeding all affected areas. The process of reseeding is time consuming but will be worth it once the lawn is in full vigor. The entire lawn does not have to be replaced if the burn is isolated to small areas. Simply remove only the damaged lawn and reseed. Grass1950, the amount of fertilizer you would lose to outgassing in dry conditions is very small. If you don't water, the dew that forms overnight will dissolve some of the fertilizer and increase your chances for burn, especially with the amount the OP put down. I hope everything thing turns out OK for the OP, but to lessen the odds of damaging her lawn it would be much better to water in what was put down. Rake up the dead grass blades in the fertilizer-burned areas. Remove the top 2 to 3 inches of soil in the cleared area with a shovel. Place the dead grass and soil in a wheelbarrow. Transport the removed material to a compost pile or trash bin and discard it. Fertilizer burn is the result of over fertilizing plants or applying fertilizer to wet foliage. Fertilizer contains salts, which draw moisture out of plants. When you apply excess fertilizer to plants, the result is yellow or brown discoloration and root damage. Preventing Fertilizer Burn. The good news is that fertilizer burn can be prevented. Here are some tips on preventing fertilizer burn on plants: Fertilize each plant according to its needs. You won’t get better results when you use more fertilizer and you run the risk of damaging or killing your plants.

passage_text: Protists are important in ecology and in studies of evolution. Photosynthetic protists in aquatic environments have similar importance as plants in terrestrial environments. Most protists are aquatic and are a major food source in aquatic habitats. Humans, in many cultures, eat protists, especially algae 3. Best Answer: Euglena are the unicellular organism. All euglena have chloroplasts and can make their own food by photosynthesis. They are not completely autotrophic though, euglena can also absorb food from their environment. Paramecium are unicellular organism. Paramecium are heterotrophic and feed on bacteria. Amoeba are unicellular organism. BOT 3015L (Outlaw/Sherdan/Aghoram); Page 1 of 6 Chapter 10 Overview of Autotrophic and Heterotrophic Protists Objectives Protista. Establish familiarity with the Protista. Understand some aspects of the importance of protists. Know the primary differences between autotrophs and heterotrophs. BOT 3015L (Outlaw/Sherdan/Aghoram); Page 5 of 6 mitosis, that are released into the surrounding water. External fertilization is followed by the formation of a diploid zygote that then undergoes meiosis. 5. Draw and label the main filament, branches, nodes, and gametangia of Chara without magnification and/or under 4x. An  autotroph is also referred to as a producer. An example of an  autotroph is algae. A heterotroph is an organism that receives its  food from other sources. It is a multicellular or unicellular  organism. Organisms that are consumers or decomposers are  heterotrophs. A parasite is also a heterotroph. A parasite feeds  off other organisms for its food. An example of a parasite is a  deet tick. An example of a decomposing heterotroph is an earthworm. Specimen 3: Volvox, a colonial green alga Volvox 7 is the dead-end evolutionary pinnacle of a colonial green alga that is based on Chlamydomonas-derived cells. The number of cells in the colony is specific to the particular species and ranges from 500-60,000. Nutrition in Autotrophic Organisms. In this, organisms synthesize the essential organic compounds from inorganic compounds like carbon dioxide and water in the presence of radiant energy of sunlight trapped by magnesium ions (Mg 2+) containing green pigment, chlorophyll. The process is called photosynthesis. Some non green bacteria manufacture their organic food from inorganic substances in the presence of energy derived from the oxidation of simple inorganic compounds of sulphur and iron etc. For example sulphur and iron bacteria. This process is called chemosynthesis. And organisms are called chemoautotroph. This is characteristic of all animals and fungi, some protists (for example Trypanosona, Paramecium, Amoeba), many bacteria, (for example pseudomonas) and some non green plants (for example Parasitic plants like cuscuta) they take readymade organic food from other dead or living plants and animals. Thus plants are autotrophic orgainsms because they synthesize their own food themselves. There are organisms like animals that are not capable of making their food from sunlight and carbon dioxide and water. Animals get their food from plants and other animals. They are called heterotrophic organisms.

passage_text: However, drops up to 10 mm (equivalent in volume to a sphere of radius 4.5 mm) are theoretically stable and could be levitated in a wind tunnel. The largest recorded raindrop was 8.8 mm in diameter, located at the base of a cumulus congestus cloud in the vicinity of Kwajalein Atoll in July 1999. A droplet with a diameter of 3 mm has a terminal velocity of approximately 8 m/s. Drops smaller than 1 mm in diameter will attain 95% of their terminal velocity within 2 m. But above this size the distance to get to terminal velocity increases sharply. An example is a drop with a diameter of 2 mm that may achieve this at 5.6 m. A raindrop may have a maximum diameter of 0.25 centimeter.. 2.5 mm. Rain.. Encyclopedia Encarta .1st ed. CD-ROM. New York: Microsoft, 2000. Raindrops generally have a diameter greater than 0.5 mm (0.02 in.). Close enough to the earth to encounter air resistance, this acceleration is 9.8 meters per second squared, or 32 feet per second squared. 3. Calculate the downward pull of gravity. The force with which the falling object is being pulled down equals the object's mass times acceleration due to gravity, or F = MA. This number, multiplied by two, goes in the top of the terminal velocity formula. 4. Figure out the drag force that is opposing the downward pull of gravity. If you know the velocity of the object, but not the drag force, you can use the formula to calculate the drag force. This is (C*ρ*A*(v^2))/2. The mass m of the drop hanging from the end of the tube can be found by equating the force due to gravity () with the component of the surface tension in the vertical direction () giving the formula. where α is the angle of contact with the tube, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. Use the terminal velocity formula, v = the square root of ((2*m*g)/(ρ*A*C)). Plug the following values into that formula to solve for v, terminal velocity. 1  m = mass of the falling object. 2  g = the acceleration due to gravity. Raindrop sizes typically range from 0.5 mm to 4 mm, with size distributions quickly decreasing past diameters larger than 2-2.5 mm. Scientists traditionally thought that the variation in the size of raindrops was due to collisions on the way down to the ground. In fact, they are actually oblate spheroids, or spheres with the nose smashed in. Different sources approximate different ranges for the measure of a diameter of a raindrop. However, on the average, a raindrop is between 0.1 to 5 millimeters. There are some exceptions; rarely, raindrops of 8 millimeters were known to occur. Sizes larger than that do not normally occur because the raindrop particles simply break up or collide with other neighboring particles. By suspending drops of known size, he determined that small drops up to about 2 mm (0.08 inches) in diameter fell as spheres. Larger drops, however, deformed while falling acquiring a shape with a flat bottom and rounded top similar to that of a hamburger bun.

passage_text: Low Sodium Low Potassium Foods List. On this page we offer a searchable collection of nutritional data on thousands of foods for healthy diet. Healthy eating is not only beneficial to weight loss, but will obviously improve your health. Alleviation of High Blood Pressure (Hypertension) - Studies show that a diet high in potassium, especially potassium from fruits and vegetables, lowers blood pressure. This is especially true if the increase in potassium foods is not accompanied by an increase in high sodium foods. High potassium foods include beans, dark leafy greens, potatoes, squash, yogurt, fish, avocados, mushrooms, and bananas. The current daily value for potassium is 3,500 milligrams (mg). That is because the kidneys regulate potassium. If they aren’t working correctly, the potassium may not be flushed out of the body properly. To minimize potassium buildup, a person with chronic kidney disease should stick to a low-potassium diet of between 1,500 and 2,000 milligrams (mg) per day. Limiting phosphorus, sodium, and fluids may also be important for people with kidney dysfunction. Watch portions on all foods. Be careful with coffee. The National Kidney Foundation recommends that people who should limit their potassium should limit their coffee in take to 1 cup per day. There are still plenty of nutritious, delicious, low-potassium options for people with kidney disease, Armul says. Food Sources of Potassium. Food Sources of Potassium ranked by milligrams of potassium per standard amount, also showing calories in the standard amount. (The AI for adults is 4,700 mg/day potassium.) Food, Standard Amount Potassium (mg) Calories. Sweetpotato, baked, 1 potato (146 g) 694 131. Tomato paste, 1/4 cup 664 54. It is important for disease prevention such as: diabetes, heart disease, high cholesterol, anemia, high blood pressure, and cancer. All the nutritional data of foods is based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture database for standard reference SR22. Below is a list of high potassium foods ranked by common serving sizes, for more see the lists of high potassium foods by nutrient density, potassium rich foods, fruits high in potassium, and vegetables high in potassium. LOW POTASSIUM DIET. INTRODUCTION. Potassium is a mineral that the body needs for normal cell and muscle function. When blood. levels of potassium are too high, heart contractions can be affected. Dietary intake is the main. source of potassium for the body. This diet limits potassium intake to less than 60 mmol per. day. AIMS. High-Fiber means 5 grams or more fiber per serving. A food must have less than 5g of sugar (natural or added) per 100g or 2.5g of sugar per 100mls to be a low sugar food. Sugar-free means less than 0.5g of sugar per 100g or per 100ml.

No, they do not make good good pets unless you have a pond and enough money fo their food. Crocodiles and alligators became illegal to buy in the seventies as pets because people did not realize they got so large (10 ft long). Best Answer: Crocodiles do not make good pets. They require difficult environments to set up and maintain. All it takes is one disobedient neighbor's kid to sneak into your yard and get mauled or killed by your pet to ruin your life forever.

passage_text: Innocent’s founders Rich, Jon and Adam started the foundation in 2004 to formalise innocent’s commitment to donating part of its profits to help those who need it more than we do. Innocent has committed to donate at least 10% of profits to charity every year. Yes. Any donation you made on or by December 31, 2008 will qualify as a deduction for 2008. Any donations made in 2009 (even at 12:01 a.m. on New Year's Day) go towards the 2009 tax year. So if you're looking for a tax benefit for this year, you'll want to make that donation before December 31, 2008. We seek to redistribute some of the wealth that our business creates to those people that need it. Innocent donates a minimum of 10% of its profits each year to charity, most of which goes to the innocent foundation, which we set up in 2004 with a vision to help build sustainable futures for the world’s poorest people. For example, if you gave $100 to a museum and received a book in return that sells regularly for $25, you can claim $75 as a charitable deduction. The IRS has a worksheet to help you determine how many of your donations are tax-deductible. Back to top. I want to donate as much as I can this year. Over the past decade, the charity has raised $13.8 million in cash donations and steered $8.3 million of that to its for-profit fundraisers.

Few people realize how large charities have become, how many vital services they provide, and how much funding flows through them each year. Without charities and non-profits, America would simply not be able to operate. Their operations are so big that during 2014, total giving was more than $358 billion. Of the $229 billion that Americans donated in 2009, about half went to religious institutions. Above, members tithe during services at the New First Missionary Baptist Church in Charleston, W.Va.

You can download this form and the instructions for how to fill it out from the IRS Web site.

Stomach Ulcers in Women – Gender Specific Differences. Truth be told, there is not much difference between peptic ulcers in women versus those in men; symptoms, causes, and treatments are virtually the same. The only unusual thing about stomach ulcers across the genders is that men are actually about twice as likely to develop an ulcer as women.

Peptic ulcers, or peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is a condition wherein ulcers are formed in the esophagus, stomach, and the duodenum lining. Esophagus is a muscular tube that carries the food and water we consume, to the stomach. Because of the risk associated with peptic ulcer complications, it is extremely important to pay attention to duodenal ulcer symptoms. Once identified, treatment can begin, and it varies depending upon what is causing the ulcers. If H. Pylori is the culprit, antibiotics are often employed. Peptic ulcer disease is characterized by sores, or ulcerations, in the lining tissues of the stomach or the duodenum, the first portion of the small intestine. Peptic ulcers can be caused by a number of conditions, including certain medications, excessive alcohol use, and other medical conditions.

passage_text: Pdoc gave me ativan 0.5mg PRN. In the beginning, that was enough to make me feel fairly calm and sleepy. I took it rarely, like maybe 1 or 2 days/week. Over the last few months, I've been taking it more often, like 0.5mg 4-5 days/week. Pdoc knows and is perfectly fine with it. ativan, xanax, anxiety, generalized anxiety disorder, lorazepam. My Dr prescribed 1 mg of Lorazepam to help me on an upcoming flight from Atlanta to London (in 5 days). I have taken Xanax in the past, but never Lorazepam. I tried it last Sunday night at bedtime (a week ago), and within the hour, I was out like a light. I didn't wake up during the night like I always do; instead, I slept for a good 7 hours. And ain't none of us can say what it'll do to you. posted by Netzapper at 8:27 PM on August 11, 2010 [6 favorites] It is worth noting that Ativan comes in three tablet sizes -- .5 mg, 1 mg and 2 mg. To me this indicates that .5 mg is the very smallest dose and it's not unreasonable to take 1 mg. Ativan (lorazepam) leaves your system very quickly (wikipedia), so you are not likely to feel lasting effects tomorrow, as long as you're giving yourself overnight to sleep. I'd take the pill and not worry about it. posted by ella wren at 8:26 PM on August 11, 2010. Look, nobody here can answer the question for you. Trending Now. Answers. Best Answer: initial adult dose of lorazepam for anxiety is 1 mg from 2 to 3 times a day & while maintenance dose 1 to 2 mg from 2 to 3 times a day which means you should increase your dose , never mind the addiction man you will not addict you will take just 1 or 2 weeks only. The recommended starting dose of Ativan for anxiety treatment is Ativan 1 mg two to three times daily. For insomnia due to anxiety, the recommended starting dose is 2 mg to 4 mg once daily at bedtime. Elderly people may be more sensitive to the effects of Ativan. Posted August 18, 2011. I have ativan .5mg (which is the smallest dose you can get) as a PRN too. Some days I take none, some days I take 3 or 4. I'm Rx'd for 2/day. My pdoc knows I take it this way and is fine with it, but you don't want to take it in such a way that you're running out before you can get more. Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine. It is approved for the treatment of anxiety, status epilepticus (continuous seizures), and as a medication given right before anesthesia. However, benzodiazepines are also commonly used to treat difficulty sleeping and alcohol withdrawal. When starting lorazepam, anxiety or insomnia may improve rapidly or over a period of days. Benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam, are often used for short periods of time only. They may produce emotional and/or physical dependence (addiction) even when used as recommended. Only your healthcare provider can determine the length of treatment that is right for you. The recommended starting dosage of Ativan for anxiety treatment is 1 mg two to three times daily. When taking Ativan for insomnia due to anxiety, the recommended starting dose is 2 mg to 4 mg once daily at bedtime. Serious problems can occur if you take Ativan at higher dosages or for a longer period of time than your healthcare provider recommends.

passage_text: Oscars: 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' Has Best Picture Nomination Potential (Analysis) THR's awards analyst argues J.J. Abrams' film could become the franchise's first installment since the original to land above-the-line noms. (Spoiler free.) Feb 29, 2016. 1  The on-stage Oscar antics of Star Wars droids C-3PO, R2-D2 and BB-8 may have charmed the Academy Awards audience, but Star Wars: The Force Awakens did not fare so well, failing to win any of its five nominations. 50th Academy Awards. The 50th Academy Awards were held at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles, California on April 3, 1978. The ceremonies were presided over by Bob Hope, who hosted the awards for the nineteenth and last time. Annie Hall was the last Best Picture winner to be nominated for just five awards until The Departed 29 years later in 2006. Jason Robards became the fourth actor to win back-to-back Oscars, following Luise Rainer, Spencer Tracy, and Katharine Hepburn. This marks the most nominations for a Star Wars film since the release of the original Star Wars in 1977, which received 10 nods and won six Oscars; The Empire Strikes Back (1980) received three nominations, winning two Oscars; Return of the Jedi (1983) nabbed four nominations with one win; The Phantom Menace (1999) captured three nominations; ... The Star Wars franchise has actually gathered nine Academy Awards in total. Most of them are technical, which is sadly to be expected for a blockbuster film. The six films have received even more nominations. Here is a quick breakdown of how every Star Wars movie did at the Academy Awards, and what we can expect this year for The Force Awakens. ‘Star Wars: The Force Awakens’ Fails to Win an Oscar. The on-stage Oscar antics of Star Wars droids C-3PO, R2-D2 and BB-8 may have charmed the Academy Awards audience, but Star Wars: The Force Awakens did not fare so well, failing to win any of its five nominations. A New Hope. The film also received a Special Achievement For Ben Burtt in Sound. The most interesting win, for Star Wars insiders, is the one for film editing — because it went to George Lucas' now ex-wife Marcia Lucas, and her name is no longer anywhere to be found on copies of the film. And seeing Star Wars: The Force Awakens at its world premiere on Monday night — the biggest Hollywood premiere in the 21st century — undoubtedly boosted the way I and others felt about it. Categories include Original Score, Visual Effects, and more. Nominations for the 88th Annual Academy Awards were announced today, and the latest film in the Star Wars saga, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, has been nominated in five categories: Film Editing – Maryann Brandon and Mary Jo Markey. Original Score – John Williams.

passage_text: Trump tightens grip on U.S. Republican nomination. NEW YORK Front-runner Donald Trump showed signs of tightening his grip on the Republican U.S. presidential nomination on Wednesday when chief rival Ted Cruz acknowledged his own only hope of wresting control is a contested convention. World leaders are “concerned” about how a Donald Trump presidency would affect relationships between their countries and the United States, Ambassador Caroline Kennedy said Thursday in Japan. “I think people are concerned,” Kennedy, the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, told ABC News. Cruz, at a news conference on the sidelines of a Republican National Committee meeting in Hollywood, Florida, said neither he nor Trump will amass the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination without a contested convention in Cleveland starting on July 18. Trump also was hit with tough questions, many from The Washington Post’s David A. Fahrenthold, about whether he had lived up to his claim of raising $6 million for veterans at an event in Iowa this past January. It turned out that one missing million-dollar donation was his own. Based on ABC News’ analysis of pledged delegates won and commitments made by unbound delegates, Trump has enough support to secure the Republican nomination for president. ABC’s MEGHAN KENEALLY reports, he now has 1,239 total delegates, according to ABC News' estimates of both pledged and superdelegates. Trump has surpassed the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the nomination. That said, he will not formally become the nominee until delegates cast their votes at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July. It’s been almost five weeks since Donald Trump’s victory in Indiana made him the presumptive Republican nominee. Here’s what’s happened since: He’s wasted time, proved to be a sore winner and veered sharply off message. WHAT TO WATCH AT THE LIBERTARIAN CONVENTION. While Donald Trump indulges in fries and a big Mac to celebrate beating 16 Republican candidates and effectively winning his party’s nomination, another party is huddling to plan a new threat. Since clinching the GOP nomination, Trump has gone off stride, off message. Be the first to know about new stories from PowerPost.

passage_text: Achalasia Causes & Symptoms. Causes of achalasia are not well understood. Factors such as viral or parasitic infections have been considered as potential causes. Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) The cause of achalasia is unknown. Theories on causation invoke infection, heredity or an abnormality of the immune system that causes the body itself to damage the esophagus (autoimmune disease). The esophagus contains both muscles and nerves. The information provided in this report is not intended for diagnostic purposes. It is provided for informational purposes only. NORD recommends that affected individuals seek the advice or counsel of their own personal physicians. It is possible that the title of this topic is not the name you selected. This disease entry is based upon medical information available through the date at the end of the topic. Since NORD's resources are limited, it is not possible to keep every entry in the Rare Disease Database completely current and accurate. It is characterized by enlargement of the esophagus, impaired ability to push food down toward the stomach (peristalsis), and failure of the ring-shaped muscle at the bottom of the esophagus, the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), to relax. It is possible that the main title of the report Achalasia is not the name you expected. Please check the synonyms listing to find the alternate name(s) and disorder subdivision(s) covered by this report. 1 Chest discomfort from esophageal dilation and/or retained food. 2  Sharp chest pain usually of unclear cause. 3  Heartburn; however, the heartburn is not characteristic of heartburn and is not helped by treatment for heartburn.  Loss of weight due to reduced intake of food. The symptoms of achalasia include: 1  Difficulty swallowing food. 2  Difficulty swallowing both solid and liquid food. 3  Regurgitation of food that is retained in the esophagus. 4  Chest discomfort from esophageal dilation and/or retained food.  Sharp chest pain usually of unclear cause. Achalasia: Introduction. Achalasia: A rare motor disorder of the esophagus characterized by inability of the lower esophageal sphincter and esophageal muscle to relax as well as dilation of the esophagus. More detailed information about the symptoms, causes, and treatments of Achalasia is available below. Click to Check. Early in achalasia, inflammation can be seen (when examined under the microscope) in the muscle of the lower esophagus, especially around the nerves. As the disease progresses, the nerves begin to degenerate and ultimately disappear, particularly the nerves that cause the lower esophageal sphincter to relax. A copy of the complete report can be downloaded free from the NORD website for registered users. The complete report contains additional information including symptoms, causes, affected population, related disorders, standard and investigational therapies (if available), and references from medical literature.

passage_text: Fields in Subclasses. An object constructed from a subclass contains all the fields that the subclass defines, and all the fields that are contained in its superclass (and the superclass of the superclass, etc. all the way to the class Object, at the root of the inheritance hierarchy). It is a subclass whose direct superclass is IntCounter (also declared in this same package); likewise, this class is a subclass whose direct superclass is Object (declared in the java.lang package). As we have seen Object has no direct superclass, because it is at the very top of the Java class hierarchy. Superclass Members Home Subclass Constructors • Constructors are not inherited. • However, the subclass can call the constructors of the superclass to initialize inherited fields. • Implicit invocation – The default constructor of the subclass automatically calls the default constructor of the superclass • For explicit invocation, use this syntax: It is the only class in Java that does not have a superclass. All Java classes inherit the methods of Object. Because every class has a superclass, classes in Java form a class hierarchy, which can be represented as a tree with Object at its root. Superclasses and Subclasses • A superclass can have multiple subclasses. • Subclasses can be superclasses of other subclasses. • A subclass can inherit directly from only one superclass. • All classes inherit from the Object class. Home Superclasses and Subclasses • A big advantage of inheritance is that we can write common code once and reuse it in subclasses. – Generalization • A subclass can define new methods and instance The basic rules for inheritance are. 1  Implicit Upcasting: We can assign a reference to a subclass object to a variable whose type is a superclass, without any casting. 2  Explicit Downcasting: We can attempt to assign a reference to a superclass object to a variable whose type is a subclass, but we must use a cast to do so. called the direct superclass. • As mentioned, a subclass can have many superclasses, but only one direct superclass. Home An Applet Hierarchy • When we wrote an applet, we defined a subclass. • We say that inheritance implements an  is a  relationship, in that a subclass object  is a  superclass object as well. • Thus, RollABall is a JApplet (its direct superclass), Applet, Panel, Container, Component, and Object. The first rule is applied at compile time, the second at runtime: (1) what methods the Java compiler ALLOWS to be called on a variable and (2) how Java determines WHICH METHOD (in the context of inheritance and overriding) to call. We can build a complicated application program from a library of many classes, some of which are related by superclass-subclass relationships, forming an inheritance hierarchy. We draw such hierarchies as follows, with each subclass beneath its superclass (with an arrow pointing to it). While a superclass may have many direct subclasses, a subclass has exactly one direct superclass. So, in this example, the ModularCounter and BoundedCounter classes extend the IntCounter class. Each subclass is in some sense more powerful than the superclass that it extends: it adds more fields and methods. Unfortunately the terms subclass and superclass seem to have exactly the opposite informal meanings. The word super implies something more powerful, but in fact it is the subclass that is more powerful. In general, if a class does not define a no-argument constructor, all its subclasses must define constructors that explicitly invoke the superclass constructor with the necessary arguments. If a class does not declare any constructors, it is given a no-argument constructor by default.

passage_text: You may have to search for document from USCIS and send it to the HR folks. EAD is NOT to be sponsored by the employer. They should be able to hire you right away with EAD. Many HR folks don't know the difference between H1B and EAD. Most EADs are valid for one year. An H-1B is program is available to F1 students who want to gain practical work experience - inside the US - in a job that’s related to their field of study. F1 students can change their status from F1 to H1B by securing a qualified H1B position with an H1B sponsor company. However, H1Bs are also available to foreign nationals who are not students. US companies use the H1B visa to hire foreign professionals for specialty occupations. AC21 (EAD) is considered as sponsorship- WTF? I had applied for a few fulltime jobs in my line of work (SYS ANAL) , and I got calls from HR that they wont be able to take me on EAD, for EAD IS CONSIDERED AS SPONSORSHIP. WTF?? anyone else faced this issue during their job search ?? Posted by adjudicator (2655) 04 Jun 2009#1. I had applied for a few fulltime jobs in my line of work (SYS ANAL) , and I got calls from HR that they wont be able to take me on EAD, for EAD IS CONSIDERED AS SPONSORSHIP. Anyone who is not a US citizen or permanent resident may need to apply for a work permit (Employment Authorization Document - EAD) before they can start working in the United States. And EAD (Employment Authorization Document) is the document that gives you permission to work when your current immigration status does not automatically carry the right to work. Many of the categories of people who must apply for an EAD before being able to work include people with pending applications. However, it is usually recommended to apply for an EAD with your I-485 application, in case you are unable to extend or maintain your H1B status in the future. Unlike H1B, an EAD allows you to work for any employer, or multiple employers at the same time (important: see the next question regarding H1B and EAD). An EAD is an Employment Authorization Document issued to foreign workers who fall into certain immigrant and nonimmigrant categories - for instance, for those who have filed a Form I-485 Application to Register for Permanent Residence or Adjust Status. If you have a pending I-485, your I-140 has been approved, and a visa number is not available to you, you are eligible for employment authorization document (EAD) that is valid for two years. AOS applicants whose priority dates are current will continue to receive 1-year EAD's. OPT is the Optional Practical Training whereas EAD is the employment authorization document. The H1B is a nonimmigrant visa classification for workers employed in the specialized field. It permits the foreign residential to work temporarily in the U.S. and perform services in a prearranged professional job.

passage_text: Symptoms by Day Past Ovulation. Some women experience many signs and symptoms very early in pregnancy, while others experience very few or even none. If you think you may be pregnant, or hope you may be, review the most common symptoms for your day past ovulation below and compare your own symptoms. Select Your Day Past Ovulation (dpo) Generally speaking, ovulation usually occurs 14 days after the beginning of your menstrual cycle, (your menstrual period being day one) Your 'fertile' period would start 4-5 days prior to ovulation, as that is how long sperm can 'survive' to 24-48 hours after, as that is how long the egg 'survives'. How many weeks pregnant am I? and learn your baby's due date so you can start planning key milestones. Please enter a valid date. Start with the first day of one period and count right up to the day before the first day of your next period. Count the first day of bleeding or spotting as day one. The average cycle length is 28 days, but can range anywhere from 20 to 45 days. Your best chances are within the first 24 hours after ovulation, but there is still a small chance two days after. So, honestly, if your ovulation really did occur on the 18th then your chances aren't that great because you would be past that 24 hour window, but I wouldn't say its impossible. If you have a short cycle, for example 21 days, and you bleed for 7 days, then you could ovulate right after your period. This is because ovulation generally occurs 12-16 days before your next period begins, and this would estimate you ovulating at days 6-10 of your cycle. Symptoms by Day Past Ovulation. Some women experience many signs and symptoms very early in pregnancy, while others experience very few or even none. If you think you may be pregnant, or hope you may be, review the most common symptoms for your day past ovulation below and compare your own symptoms. after ovulation. after ovulation. If you were expecting ovulation to happen on the 28th or 29th, it is highly likely that this is day 14 of your cycle, approximately, and the intercourse took place very early on. Ovulation itself can be affected by many things (illness, stress etc) so I wouldn't necessarily assume that you are pregnant. Each woman and each pregnancy is different but there are many common early signs of pregnancy. While most women will not notice symptoms until 2 weeks after conception or later (after they miss their period), some women do experience symptoms as early as 6-10 days after conception. During my ovulation time, how many days am I really fertile? During your window of ovulation, an egg is only available to be fertilized for about 12-24 hours. But since sperm can live in the body for 3-5 days after sex, and the egg is available for one day, your most fertile time is considered to be about 5-7 days. Mom Answers. Yes it is possible to conceive 1-2 days after ovulation!! After your egg has been released (ovulation) there is a 12-24 hour period where the egg is available to get fertilized. generally after having sex, the sperm takes about 6 hours to make its way to the egg.

A spontaneous CSF leak, as opposed to traumatically caused CSF leaks, arises idiopathically. As Adults our total body water decreases to about 60%. By the age of 60 years the our total body water (TBW) decreases to about 50%. As we age... we dry out. Cerebro-Spinal Fluid (CSF) surrounds our brain and spinal cord. A mere 140 ml of fluid bathes the brain and fills the ventricles (internal cavities of the brain). This Cerebro-Spinal Fluid replenishes itself 3-4 times each day. Now the CSF can … cause pressure in the brain and it can cause death. That's the only way I know of that has to do with csf and dying So more so, it can lead to death. But it don't necessarily cause death itself. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is located in the subarachnoid space, which is located between the arachnoid mater and pia mater of the brain and spinal cord. It's job is to protect … the brain and spinal cord. On average, the condition is developed at the age of 42, and women are twice as likely as men to develop the condition. Some people with SCSFLS chronically leak cerebrospinal fluid despite repeated attempts at patching, leading to long-term disability due to pain. Although this a popular urban legend about LSD, there is absolutely no evidence to support the claim that LSD is stored in your spinal fluid. Simply, the LSD molecule is … very fragile and breaks down very quickly when introduced to light and water. No, it is a myth that it stays in the blood, spinal fluid or brain. It is gone from the system in just a short time, mimicking chemicals in the 5HT2A serotonin receptors and l … eaving the mind reacting (tripping) that way for several hours after the drug is cleared from the body. 1 person found this useful. Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak syndrome (SCSFLS) is a medical condition in which the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) held in and around a human brain and spinal cord leaks out of the surrounding protective sac, the dura, for no apparent reason. Cerebrospinal fluid is produced by the choroid plexus in the ventricles of the brain and contained by the dura and arachnoid layers of the meninges. The brain floats in CSF, which also transports nutrients to the brain and spinal cord. As holes form in the spinal dura mater, CSF leaks out into the surrounding space.

Because Catholics believe God created human beings in his own image and likeness and that he found everything he created to be very good, the Church teaches that human body and sex must likewise be good.

We encourage you to begin with the basics to become well grounded in Church teaching on a variety of subjects. There was wide variation of opinion on how long creation took. Some said only a few days; others argued for a much longer, indefinite period. Those who took the latter view appealed to the fact that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day (2 Pet.3:8; cf. Ps. 90:4), that light was created on the first day, but the sun was not created till the fourth day (Gen.cripture established a law that twenty-four hours, including both day and night, should be given the name of day only, as if one were to say the length of one day is twenty-four hours in extent. . . . The nights in this reckoning are considered to be component parts of the days that are counted. The Roman Catholic Church has consistently condemned abortion — the direct and purposeful taking of the life of the unborn child. In principle, Catholic Christians believe that all life is sacred from conception until natural death, and the taking of innocent human life, whether born or unborn, is morally wrong.hile many other examples could be offered, the key point is that the Roman Catholic Church from the beginning has consistently upheld the sanctity of the life of the unborn child and condemned the act of direct abortion. To oppose this teaching contradicts the revelation of Sacred Scripture and Christian tradition. Marriage: Love and Life in the Divine Plan. This Pastoral Letter on marriage was approved by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in 2009. It provides a summary of Church teaching on marriage as a natural institution and as a sacrament. While broadly teaching about love, the work is nevertheless applicable to all facets of the Christian life, including that of marriage. 2  Evangelium vitae (The Gospel of Life) 1995, Pope John Paul II This papal encyclical, written by Pope John Paul II, teaches about the gift and value of human life. 1 This approach seeks not only to make understandable the rich theology of Catholic teaching on the nature of humanity created as man and woman, but also to communicate the truth and beauty of God's design of human sexuality.

Some critics say the Church and teachings by St. Paul, the Fathers of the Church and Scholastic theologians perpetuated a notion that female inferiority was divinely ordained, even though official Church teaching considers women and men to be equal, different, and complementary.he Catholic Church teaches that human life and human sexuality are inseparable. Because Catholics believe God created human beings in his own image and likeness and that he found everything he created to be very good, the Church teaches that human body and sex must likewise be good. This paper will summarize the traditional authoritative teaching of the Catholic Church on creation, evaluate the claim that recent Popes have officially endorsed theistic evolution, and show why Catholics are fully justified in holding fast to the traditional doctrine of creation.efenders of the traditional Catholic doctrine of creation do not challenge the legitimacy of Vatican II or of the 1994 Catechism. Nor do we deny that Pope St. John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI and Pope Francis have made non-authoritative statements favorable to theistic evolutionism.

If the iPad needs 12W, and the adaptor provides 12W, it can use 12W with the standard USB to flash cable that comes with your iPhone 5 or recent iPad. Limitations of micro-USB to 9W do not apply here using Apple cables because they are not micro-USB standard. However, many Apple fans don't realise that the speed of charging varies depending on the way you charge the device: there are simple tricks you can use to charge your iPhone faster. Armed with a bit of knowledge you can dramatically reduce the time it takes to charge up an iPhone's battery.

passage_text: This salary represents all orthopedic nurses, including those without advanced practice recognition, so this average is recognized as being skewed lower than what would typically be expected for nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists with an orthopedic subspecialty. 5 Statistics on Orthopedic Surgeon Income by Subspecialty Written by Heather Linder | December 19, 2013 | Print | Email Recent figures from the American Medical Group Association broke down median salaries for orthopedic surgeons based on subspecialty, according to a Houston Chronicle report. Here are five statistics on orthopedic surgeons' income.

In 2009, hip and joint surgeons made an average of $597,834, trauma orthopedic surgeons made an average annual salary of $592,563 and hand surgeons made $544,106. General orthopedic surgeons made an average annual salary of $524,259 and foot and ankle surgeons made $518,463. The average on-call rate for orthopedic surgeons was $958. The foot and ankle surgery division of the Medical College of Wisconsin's Department of Orthopaedic Surgery provides evaluation and treatment for patients with traumatic, occupational and athletic injuries, rheumatoid and degenerative arthritis, acquired and congenital deformities, neuromuscular diseases, and foot problems associated with diabetes. Orthopedic spine surgeons were compensated more than other orthopedic specialties. Spine surgeons were the most highly compensated orthopedic specialists last year, making an average annual salary of $710,055 while sports medicine physicians were second, making an average of $653,642. General orthopedic surgeons who practice at multi-specialty practices earn an average of $475,403 annually, which is more than general orthopedic surgeons who work at single-specialty practices. The highest compensated region for general orthopedic surgeons was the Midwest, where they were compensated at $536,371 on average annually, which is $12,121 more than the national average ($524,250).

passage_text: Hippocrates is widely considered to be the Father of Medicine. His contributions revolutionized the practice of medicine; but after his death the advancement stalled. Many of the invaluable lessons prescribed in that place of learning are assigned to Hippocrates. If that was the case, then it truly was Hippocrates, with his approach to healing and the role of the doctor, that influenced western medicine for thousands of years. Despite this, Hippocrates is attributed with a great many wonderful deeds and thoughts. He is recognised as the founder of the Hippocratic School of Medicine, a college that revolutionized the understanding of medicine in Ancient Greece. At least that is what we’d like to think. While his fame was such to warrant a mention from the likes of Plato and Aristotle, not much is actually known about Hippocrates the father of Medicine. Consequently, he has become the projection of what people ideally want in a physician. 460 – c. 370 BC) was a Greek physician of the Age of Pericles (Classical Greece), and is considered one of the most outstanding figures in the history of medicine. TRUE. Hippocrates is considered the father of modern medicine because he did not believe that illness was a punishment inflicted by the gods. True False. Weegy: TRUE. [  The two sons of Hippocrates, Thessalus and Draco, and his son-in-law, Polybus, were his students. According to Galen, a later physician, Polybus was Hippocrates' true successor, while Thessalus and Draco each had a son named Hippocrates. Hippocrates is mentioned in passing in the writings of two contemporaries: Plato, in Protagoras and Phaedrus, and, Aristotle 's Politics, which date from the 4th century BC. Soranus wrote that Hippocrates' father was Heraclides, a physician, and his mother was Praxitela, daughter of Tizane. Reload the page to try again! Press Cmd-0 to reset your zoom.

passage_text: Acanthamoeba - This amoeba affects the lungs and brains of infected canines. A complication of invasion by this parasitic amoeba is called granulomatous amebic meningoencephalitis, which causes inflammation and necrosis (death to tissue). Amoeba infection in dogs is caused by the invasion of the body by a parasitic organism. The amoeba is an organism that can affect humans as well as animals, and can be categorized as dependent on a host for survival, or free living. An amoeba infection in dogs can be eradicated, but is also a possibility for morbidity, depending upon the type of amoeba organism infecting the body. Amoeba parasite symptoms - What are the symptoms of internal parasites? Depends on parasite. There are many different types of parasites that may live in the intestine. With a light parasite burden, there may be no symptoms. In U.S. English, the single-celled living organism described here is an ameba. The word amoeba, with an “o”, is used as part of a scientific genus name (such as Amoeba or Acanthamoeba). In British English, both the generic organism term and genera names are spelled amoeba with an “o”. Amoebiasis: Related Patient Stories. tired of living.

Naegleria is a form of amoeba that is typically found in warm freshwater Call your doctor if your child has signs or symptoms of amebiasis, including: 1  diarrhea with blood or mucus. 2  abdominal pain. 3  fever. 4  distended abdomen. 5  pain or tenderness in the area of the liver (below the ribs on the right side) Diagnosing the infection is difficult, because initial symptoms are general: headache, fever, nausea or vomiting. When the disease sets in, people might then experience a stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, seizures and hallucinations, the CDC reports. After the start of symptoms, people die in less than a week. Another type of dysentery, called shigellosis or bacillary dysentery, is the most common type experienced in the UK, caused by the shigella bacteria. Causes of amoebic dysentery Once inside the body, amoeba clump together to form a cyst that is protected by the stomach’s digestive acid. Amoebiasis is an infection caused by the amoeba Entamoeba histolytica. Likewise amoebiasis is sometimes incorrectly used to refer to infection with other amoebae, but strictly speaking it should be reserved for Entamoeba histolytica infection. In its early stages, symptoms of PAM may be similar to symptoms of bacterial meningitis. Initial symptoms of PAM start about 5 days (range 1 to 9 days) after infection. The initial symptoms may include headache, fever, nausea, or vomiting. Later symptoms can include stiff neck, confusion, lack of attention to people and surroundings, loss of balance, seizures, and hallucinations. After the start of symptoms, the disease progresses rapidly and usually causes death within about 5 days (range 1 to 12 days). What is the actual mechanism of death from Naegleria fowleri infection? The infection destroys brain tissue causing brain swelling and death.

passage_text: The MGC Chatbox Evo is really easy to use. You can 1  : Send chats : you just have to enter the text in the dedicated input field and then to validate it by pushing the return key ou by clicking on the OK button.  Format the chats : Of course, apples last for a shorter period of time if they are not stored properly. But remember that apples, like a lot of other fresh fruits, usually do not have a use by date so you have to use the date purchased in order to calculate the expiration date of apples. You can format a chat by selecting a part (or the totality) of it and then select one of the buttons/list. Access to the different channels : you can have access to different channels restricted to only some usergroupds or for specifics use of the chatbox. I used a little cinnamon oil in my apple butter as well as some molasses and a little brown sugar, but mostly Splenda. For a refrigerator to keep things cold and reduce spoiling, it should be set to a temp of about 35-37 degrees and no higher. At that temp, its just slightly above 32 which is freezing. The labels never indicate a shelf life. I'm not sure how long it's safe, but we keep jars after they've been opened up to a month, and they've always been just fine. Just make sure you aren't eating out of the jar or adding bacteria somehow... Try looking at a recipe for applesauce. Apples Expiration Date. This range is broad because apples may be purchased, stored and prepared in many different ways, each which can result in a different expiration date. It's also hard to tell how long of a shelf life they already had at the grocery before they arrived in your home. There are so many different varieties ranging from soft and sweet to crisp and tangy. The firmer varieties, like Granny Smith, last longer than the softer varieties, like Golden Delicious. Imagine cinnamon toast and apple butter!! If you plan to do a lot of bread baking in the machine, suggest that you pick up a big 1 pound bag of yeast at BJ's or Costco. These big packages can be frozen, and keep well. Also, the yeast that you use in one recipe's cost is about one tenth the cost of those tiny packets. 1 Edit your chats (or others chats) : the edition of a chat can be done by a simple double-click on it.*.  Use specific commands : some commands can be accessible in the chatbox depending on the will of the administrator(s) of your forum. These commands let you execute specific actions of formatting, management, etc... How long it would keep, and trying to find a way to keep it fresh longer was the goal. At the moment I don't know whether this will be treat food or shoveling it in by the spoonful (at midnight of course). For how long it lasts I have seen 1 week, 2 weeks, and several weeks. Go figure. So, how long do apples last? When properly stored, the shelf life of fresh apples past their sell by date is approximately: This range is broad because apples may be purchased, stored and prepared in many different ways, each which can result in a different expiration date.

passage_text: In short, Yes, you can slap Forever stamps on a letter to Canada. However, Domestic letters in the U.S under 1 ounce (28g) costs $0.49, however you can buy Forever Stamps for $0.47 each. Starting May 31, 2015, rate for 1 ounce First-Class letter (or postcard) to Canada increase from $1.15 to $1.20. See the links below or Page on stamps.com. I can't keep up with the changes, so I always look up the rate for postage whenever I send a letter or package when I'm about to send it. Thank goodness for the Internet. The only other time in history that the cost of a stamp has gone down was in 1919, when Congress reset postage prices to their pre-World War I levels, according to a USPS spokesperson. OTTAWA—The cost of mailing a first-class letter within Canada is going up today — by 35 per cent. Canada Post is raising the price of a stamp to 85-cents, up from 63-cents. Take our poll. While the new price applies when buying stamps in bulk, it will cost $1 to buy a single first-class stamp. OTTAWA—The cost of mailing a first-class letter within Canada is going up today — by 35 per cent. Canada Post is raising the price of a stamp to 85-cents, up from 63-cents. While the new price applies when buying stamps in bulk, it will cost $1 to buy a single first-class stamp. The cost of a first-class postage stamp is now 49 cents — 3 cents more than before. Regulators approved the price hike in December, and it went into effect Sunday. Many people won't feel the increase right away: Forever stamps are good for first-class postage at whatever the future rate. Price of a Stamp. The current price of a first class stamp is 49 cents. A domestic first class letter (1 oz.) is 49 cents. The price of each additional ounce is 21 cents. It will cost you 34 cents to send a domestic postcard. Postage Rate Timeline. Sure, as long as you've enough postages. A letter same size and weight as a USA addressed letter up to 2oz is $1.15 or 3 forever stamps for Canada. Every where else it's up to 1oz, for 2oz then 5 stamps. Btw it'll be a good idea to write Air Mail and the country's name at the bottom of your envelopes. Once the USPS reaches that ceiling, it is required to roll back the 4.3% surcharge it had tacked on to first-class mail and commercial postage rates. That means that the cost of a stamp to mail a standard letter will decrease from 49 cents to 47 cents this Sunday. The price of sending a postcard will also drop by a penny, to 34 cents, while international mail will go down by a nickel, to $1.15 per letter instead of the current $1.20. Summary of the 2017 Postage Rate Increase: First Class Mail Letters (1 oz.) rates will increase from $0.47 to $0.49 when purchased at the Post Office. Each additional ounce will cost $0.21. The discounted “Metered Mail” category for First Class Mail Letters (1 oz.), which includes online postage providers and postage meters, will decrease from $0.465 to $0.46. Each additional ounce will cost $0.21. First Class Mail Flats (1 oz.) will increase from $0.94 to $0.98.

passage_text: Two Types of Minerals in Food. Dairy foods are good sources of calcium, the major mineral found in the body. There are two types of minerals in food, and both are essential for good health.Major minerals are required in relatively large quantities, over 250 milligrams per day. Examples include calcium, sodium, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium and chloride.Minor minerals, or trace minerals as they are commonly called, include iron, copper, fluoride, chromium, iodine, zinc, molybdenum and manganese. Less than 25 milligrams of each of these are required daily.xamples include calcium, sodium, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium and chloride. Minor minerals, or trace minerals as they are commonly called, include iron, copper, fluoride, chromium, iodine, zinc, molybdenum and manganese. Less than 25 milligrams of each of these are required daily. Minerals are vital to the structure of all bodily tissues, including teeth, bones, blood, skin and muscles. These essential, non-organic nutrients are present in every cell and account for about 4 percent of your body weight, according to the American Dietetic Association.ertain minerals are more readily absorbed when consumed with – or without – specific nutrients or phytochemicals. Oxalates, which occur in many plant-based foods, decrease the absorption rate of calcium, magnesium and iron. Caffeine also interferes with calcium, as does a high sodium intake. Although the above list of minerals found in food is not a comprehensive list, most of these foods that contain these all-important minerals are classified in the 10 Healthiest Foods.he levels of all of minerals in foods vary depending on the nutrients of the soil where the food is grown. In the case of meats, the levels of minerals in the meat correspond directly to the amount of minerals contained in the plants that the animals have eaten. There are 14 considered in the list below. These 14 minerals are divided into two types: Macro minerals and trace minerals. A mineral is considered a macro mineral if your body requires over 100 mg of that particular element. Less than 100 mg and it’s considered a trace element.Both types of minerals are important for health, but the body needs far greater amounts of macro minerals than trace minerals.he levels of all of minerals in foods vary depending on the nutrients of the soil where the food is grown. In the case of meats, the levels of minerals in the meat correspond directly to the amount of minerals contained in the plants that the animals have eaten. Common Imbalances. Minerals occur in a wide range of foods, but certain foods – such as dried beans, peas and lentils, nuts and seeds, dried fruit, dark leafy vegetables and whole grains – tend to be particularly rich sources.ertain minerals are more readily absorbed when consumed with – or without – specific nutrients or phytochemicals. Oxalates, which occur in many plant-based foods, decrease the absorption rate of calcium, magnesium and iron. Caffeine also interferes with calcium, as does a high sodium intake. These nutrients are known as major minerals, or macro-minerals, because you need more than 250 milligrams a day. Most major minerals actually have recommended intake levels above 1,000 milligrams per day.

The downfall with iron in cereal is that it’s nonheme, a type of iron that is difficult for your body to absorb. Just pile a little fruit onto your cereal; the vitamin C improves nonheme iron absorption.Very few foods are natural sources of vitamin D, but you can get it through fortified foods, including cereals.our bowl of cereal jump-starts your vitamin and mineral intake. Fortified breakfast cereals can add an enormous amount of vitamins and minerals to your diet. While each brand is different, you’ll usually see iron, vitamin D and vitamin B-12 in about any variety. The body needs many minerals; these are called essential minerals. Essential minerals are sometimes divided up into major minerals (macrominerals) and trace minerals (microminerals). These two groups of minerals are equally important, but trace minerals are needed in smaller amounts than major minerals.he amounts needed in the body are not an indication of their importance. A balanced diet usually provides all of the essential minerals. The two tables below list minerals, what they do in the body (their functions), and their sources in food.

passage_text: ) Often, setting up a repayment plan is the best solution for you and the indebted homeowners. However, if you're willing to work with delinquent homeowners, make sure you create a plan that protects your association and that homeowners are likely to follow. Here are some tips. 1) File a lien first. If you are planning on building a deck onto a townhouse chances are good that you will need to contact a HOA. Each Association works in its own way, imposing different levels of restrictions in an attempt to maintain consistency throughout the development. For instance some Associations may only allow certain types of materials for decks or require a certain style of guardrails to match neighboring decks. If your deck meets the requirements they will usually draft a short letter granting permission to build the project. HOA Finances: Payment Plan Dos and Don'ts. Sometimes it pays to be nice, and that can be especially true when you've got delinquent owners. Not all people behind in their assessments are lazy deadbeats who are happily skipping away from the financial mess they've created. By guiding your HOA with a strategic plan, you can: 1  Make the board’s actions more consistent. 2  Schedule projects in a proactive manner to take advantage of pricing opportunities and timing. 3  Place decisions required for implementation on an Annual Calendar to have adequate time to prepare. 3) Get documentation. For a payment plan to be the right solution, you have to have all the right factors lined up, says Landis. You need to determine the homeowners' ability to pay and get the assurance that they're not going to take other steps, like taking out a credit line, to prejudice your position. So you probably want to see the status of their mortgage, a credit report, and a pay stub.. 4) Create documentation. Even with a payment plan, I'd file a lien because it protects me from anybody else getting ahead of me in getting the money. If the debtors are getting sued because they didn't pay a credit card bill or are behind on their leased car, I want my lien to be ahead of those judgments.. 2) Ask for a plan. There are four documents you need in order to see your HOA's financial big picture: 1  Most current month’s balance sheet-Tells how much cash your HOA has, how much money is owed to your association, and how much your association owes to vendors and/or lenders. Most people know if their house is under the authority of an Association, if there is any question the Building Inspections Department will let you know before you submit your permit. There are over 23 million homes across America that are managed under HOA’s. Developing the Plan. Developing a strategic plan for your HOA will require a commitment of about 10 – 15 hours by the association's board and each of its members. The time commitment is divided into four specific tasks to help your HOA move through the process as steadily as possible. Find out what forms need to be filled out and where to find them. Also ask if there are pre-approved colors that must be used or if you are free to make your own selection. Also ask them if there is any guidance they can give you on color selection based on their experience.

This makes a intolerance in barley differs from a barley allergy or various other issues. Coeliac disease was excluded in all. The most important allergen was Wheat, followed by Barley and Rye. Among adults with cereal allergy, sensitisation to other allergens was common, especially to Lolium perenne (Rye grass) pollen (37). Anaphylaxis following the ingestion of Barley may occur. Thus, Rye and Barley may elicit these symptoms in patients with Wheat-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis, and vice versa (15). Due to this cross-reactivity, treatment with a Gluten-free diet, i.e., a diet excluding Wheat, Rye, and Barley, is indicated for all patients with WDEIA. Digestion tract Barley Intolerance Symptoms. There are a selection of different digestion tract barley intolerance indicators as well. These symptoms and signs will definitely vary significantly relying on the individual. Food intolerances appear themselves in various methods everybody. IgE-mediated reactions. Barley may commonly induce symptoms of food allergy in sensitised individuals. (1) Symptoms may include gastrointestinal distress, atopic dermatitis and urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis and food-dependant, exercise-induced anaphylaxis, wheezing and baker's asthma. Barley Intolerance Treatment. Some approach is to get rid of barley from his/her diet plan routine. This does not typically need to be a lasting modification. Numerous people that have a barley intolerance have the capacity to return to eating barley at a later day without having the symptoms return. A number of allergens have been isolated from Barley. 1  In 132 Pig farm-workers, 43 showed IgE reactivity to 15 components of Barley with molecular masses ranging from 14 kDa to 148 kDa. The major allergen appeared to be a 37 kDa protein and was found in 32 (74.4%) of the 43 immunoblot-positive serum samples. A number of allergens have been characterised: 1  Hor v 15, a 16 kDa protein, previously known as Hor v 1, an alpha-amylase/trypsin inhibitor (3-12). 2  Hor v 16, an alpha-amylase (3,13) 3  Hor v 17, a beta-amylase (3). 4  Hor v 21, also known as hordein (3,14-15). 5  Hor v LTP, a 10 kDa protein, a lipid transfer protein (7,9,14,16). These findings suggest that Rye and Barley may also elicit symptoms in patients with Wheat-dependent, exercise-induced ana-phylaxis (15). Due to this cross-reactivity, treatment with a Gluten-free diet, i.e., a diet excluding Wheat, Rye, and Barley, is indicated for all patients with WDEIA (32). Barley is the fourth most important grain in the world, after Wheat, Maize and Rice. Most of the Barley now grown in the Western world is used either for animal fodder or, when malted, in the brewing and distilling industries. Barley is an erect annual grass, producing grain in bristly-bearded terminal spikes. Environment

passage_text: You shouldn't even brush your teeth for the first day of recovery. According to the offices of practicing oral surgeon Dr. Joseph Arzadon of Arlington, Virginia, typical wisdom teeth recovery time is three to four days, although it can be as long as one week. The length of recovery depends a lot on how badly the wisdom teeth were impacted and how they were erupting. Rinse your mouth out with salt water. The day after wisdom teeth removal surgery, create a mouth rinse out of salt and warm water. Rinse with this mixture several times a day, especially after eating or drinking, to reduce swelling and pain. Healing After Wisdom Teeth Removal. The initial healing phase, which closes up the socket, usually takes 2-3 weeks. The surrounding bone can take 3- 6 months to completely settle into place. However, pain should be lessening by the second day. In the First 24 Hours After Extraction: You can expect some oozing from the socket for about the first 24 hours during wisdom teeth removal recovery. Even a minor amount of bleeding may appear worse than it is, as it will be mixed with a larger amount of saliva. Add your answer. How long is the typical recovery time from Wisdom Teeth removal? I'm getting my Wisdom Teeth taken out this Friday morning (bright and early at 7AM!), but my family is going out-of-state for the weekend (Leaving Fri. afternoon, getting back Sun. afternoon) for a wedding. First things first, you'll want to get your questions on the procedure answered. If you opt to have your wisdom teeth extracted, your dentist may refer you to an oral surgeon to perform the procedure. After surgery, it's normal to experience some pain, discomfort and swelling. These wisdom teeth removal tips can help ensure your surgery and recovery go as smoothly as possible: To prevent potential problems after removing wisdom teeth, here are your post-extraction healing instructions: Swelling. Apply ice packs to the outside of your mouth intermittently (20 minutes on, 20 minutes off) for up to two days to minimize swelling, bruising or any discomfort. If your tooth was infected prior to removal, your dentist may ask you to use warm, moist compresses rather than ice. Expect some bleeding, and keep a gauze pad over the extraction site for 30 minutes after surgery. For heavier bleeding, suggests Conestoga Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery, bite down on a gauze pad or place your fingers over the pad consistently for 30 minutes before removing it. The cold helps to reduce the inflammation and ease any discomfort. Your dentist or oral surgeon should instruct you on how to take care of your mouth for the recovery period. You may be told to avoid brushing, spitting, flossing and rinsing for 24 hours. After that, you can gently brush your teeth.

In order to make a reasonable and logical analysis, you need to apply critical reading skills to a text, given source, or artifact that you intend on analyzing.

Some specific questions can guide you in your critical reading process. You can use them in reading the text, and if asked to, you can use them in writing a formal analysis. They tell us how society sees us and at the same time, tell us how to behave in society. They promote a notion of consensus - that there is a core group of which we are a part, a core that defines the social order, and that it is in our interest to maintain. Rhetoric is a term that is widely used in many forms, and by itself can mean a great many things. Some use the term in association with political rhetoric, to name the voice and stance, as well as the language that becomes the nature of politics.

passage_text: 1 In the mid-range, expect to pay $500 to $1,000 for an off-the rack or custom-made wedding dress, with a small to medium amount of beading or lace detail, from a chain bridal retailer or bridal boutique. Update: the alterations came to $135, is that normal considering the complexity of the skirt? there are no alterations need on the bust or bodice. Best Answer: How big is this dress? For a wedding dress that needs bustling and hemming, I'd say 100-200 is average. For a simple gown, I'd say $30-50. It depends on multiple things. The fabric-how easy is it to work with. Chiffon overlays are very difficult b/c the fabric is so delicate. 1 Do not forget to factor in the cost of alterations, which can run from $20 for a small nip or tuck in the bodice to $200 or more for more labor-intensive work. 2  If you buy your dress at a bridal salon, ask whether alterations are included and, if not, get a written estimate of the alteration costs ahead of time. 1 And on the high end, expect to pay $2,000 to $5,000 and up for a custom-made designer dress in silk, sometimes with elaborate embellishments of hand-stitched lace or beading, from an upscale wedding boutique. 2  The average cost for a wedding dress is $1,505, according to The Bridal Association of America. Rrobinson15 member. I work for a French wedding dress designer and I can tell you the cost of the dress does not factor into the cost of the alterations. If you have a $40 dollar dress or $400 your alterations will be the same. 1 Most wedding dresses will require special undergarments, which vary depending on the style. 2  At minimum, most brides pay $30 and up for a strapless bra and many buy a body-slimming garment such as Spanx for about $50. 3  Make sure to try on the undergarments with the dress as early as possible. We tried on bridesmaid dresses at DB, and asked about alteration costs. The sales lady flat out told me not to get them done there, she told me the alteration I wanted (on a bridesmaid dresses) would be $150 through DB, but that she gaurenteed I could find a local seamstress who would do it for less than $20. It really depends on the dress and where you're located. All vendors in different areas charge different rates. In the DC area to alter a simple gown will be average $500 ... if the gown is more complex, then the alterations are more expensive. 1 And TheKnot.com offers shopping tips. 2  If you want to buy a designer dress but do not want to pay designer prices and are willing to consider a worn-once dress, sites such as Preowned Wedding Dresses.com and eBay offer dresses that originally costs thousands of dollars for up to 70 percent off.

passage_text: Interruptions that cause breaks in task contribute to medical errors and risk potential harm to patients. Interruptions are common in the emergency department (ED) and each increases the risk of task incompletion. Although emergency physicians often consider themselves to be effective and efficient multitaskers, evidence indicates that multitasking does not exist in the way that physicians have historically assumed. The stated goal of the government’s effort to introduce pay-for-performance measures is to improve quality of care, but emergency physicians are concerned that patient care will be sacrificed in favor of cost reduction and efficiency. This article reviews the literature on task switching and multitasking in a variety of disciplines—including cognitive science, human factors engineering, business, and medicine—to define and describe the successful performance of task switching and multitasking in emergency medicine. A selection of combined searches was conducted using the following text strings: emergency department, ED, performance indicator(s), performance measure(s), quality assessment, quality assurance, and quality improvement. For example, “Hospital emergency departments in the US are facing increasing. challenges due to growth in patient demand for their services, and inability to increase. capacity to match demand” (Medeiros, Swenson, & DeFlitch, 2008). Patient Flows to Improve Hospital Performance. There has been a rapid increase in the number of patients visiting the emergency department; for example, twenty three million more people went to the emergency department in 2003. than a decade earlier. During the same time period, the number of hospitals in the United. An example of some multi tasking objectives could read as follows . To achieve the object of the exercise students must be able to . Conduct large-scale scene assessment. Identify resource requirements. Secure and stabilise the scene. Task and direct rescue teams. Continual assessments and work detail redeployment. Following the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic literature review of review articles reporting accentuated ED performance measures was conducted in the databases of PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. Evaluation of emergency department (ED) performance remains a difficult task due to the lack of consensus on performance measures that reflects high quality, efficiency, and sustainability. Emergency physicians are dedicated to providing the highest quality of emergency care to all patients in a safe and timely manner. The greatest threats to patient safety and quality in the emergency department are overcrowding and the on-call specialist shortage. ACEP supports the use of technology to improve patient safety and is working with the federal government to develop quality improvement measures that advance patient care.

As an electrical engineer for a power company I see on average a house that is 1600-2000 square feet and having electric appliances except for the furnace use an average of 1500Kwatt-hours per month making 50 Kwatt-hours per day and a total of 18,000 Kwatt-hours per year.or a family, the average is anywhere from 50-100 dollars a month, though it varies greatly. It wholly depends on the usage. no body can define a monthly amount. The answer to … this question is dependent upon where you live in the country. The utility company sets the price in cents per kilowatt per hour of use. Household electricity use: 6,000 kWh per household per year for 3 residents average per household. So the household use per capita is 2,000 kWh or about of per capita electricity from all applications. Household Natural Gas use: 400 therms per household x 30 give 12,000 kWh equivalent electricity.Since much of the electricity is generated by natural gas, it is not totally unreasonable to compare these two in kilowatt hours.ousehold Natural Gas use: 400 therms per household x 30 give 12,000 kWh equivalent electricity.

passage_text: A grand jury subpoena is the beginning of the grand jury indictment process. A prosecutor will issue a grand jury subpoena in order to collect evidence for the upcoming case. This is usually done because the prosecutor suspects an element of criminal behavior and wants to capture that evidence to build a case. After an arrest is made, but before anyone is charged with a crime, the police create an arrest report and forward it to the prosecutor. The report summarizes the events leading up to the arrest and the details of the arrest (dates, time, location, witnesses, etc). Based on this report, the prosecutor can either: Such a perjury charge may stand even when the grand jury fails to hand down any indictment for what it was ostensibly investigating. If you have been indicted, subpoenaed, or contacted by the federal government contact the Grand Jury Resistance Project or call the National Lawyers Guild Hotline at 415-285-1041. Historically, in most common law jurisdictions, an indictment was handed up by a grand jury, which returned a true bill if it found cause to make the charge, or no bill if it did not find cause. In the federal legal system, the grand jury is used to decide whether someone should be charged (indicted) for a serious crime. The grand jury hears evidence presented by the prosecutor: the U.S. Attorney. The grand jury uses subpoenas to gather this evidence. It can subpoena documents, physical evidence, and witnesses to testify. An indictment (/ɪnˈdaɪtmənt/ in-DYT-mənt), in the common law system, is a formal accusation that a person has committed a crime. In jurisdictions that use the concept of felonies, the most serious criminal offence is a felony; jurisdictions that do not use the concept of felonies often use that of an indictable offence—an offence that requires an indictment. First, there is an arrest and the police report that follows. The prosecutor then reads the police report and decides whether or not the arrested should be charged with a crime. Alternatively, the prosecutor can go to a grand jury and ask them to decide what criminal charges should be filed (an indictment). Finally, a judge holds a preliminary hearing where he or she decides whether there is enough evidence to proceed. The Arrest and Report. A grand jury indictment is a formal, written charge issued by a grand jury in a criminal case. Typically, the jury is charged with determining whether enough evidence exists to charge a suspect with a criminal offense. The jury usually consists of 12 average people who are randomly selected. What happens after a grand jury indictment is that the defendant is officially charged with a crime and a preliminary hearing is given so that the defendant can face the charges in person for the first time. This is really the start of the criminal trial.

passage_text: All patients presenting to the the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of acute myocardial infarction (MI) should be evaluated with a targeted history and focused physical examination (see Presentation). A heart attack (myocardial infarction) is usually caused by a blood clot, which stops the blood flowing to a part of your heart muscle. You should call for an ambulance immediately if you develop severe chest pain. Some newer terms used by doctors. A heart attack and myocardial infarction (MI) are commonly used terms, and mean the same thing. However, the term MI is used less often now by doctors. This is because there are actually a range of conditions that can be caused by a sudden reduction in blood flow in a coronary artery. The first goal for healthcare professionals in management of acute myocardial infarction (MI) is to diagnose the condition in a very rapid manner. As a general rule, initial therapy for acute MI is directed toward restoration of perfusion as soon as possible to salvage as much of the jeopardized myocardium as possible. Description. 1  Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is considered to be closely related to the pathogenesis and clinical presentation of unstable angina (UA). 2  NSTEMI is defined by electrocardiographic ST-segment depression or prominent T-wave inversion and/or elevation of cardiac biomarkers in the absence of ST-segment elevation. The elevation of cardiac biomarkers may not be detectable for hours after presentation. Myocardial infarction (MI), or heart attack, is an interruption of blood supply to part or all of the heart, causing the muscle cells to die. The most common cause is an occlusion (blockage) of a coronary artery due to rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque (an unstable collection of lipids and white blood cells in the wall of an artery). Myocardial Infarction: More Complex Than Plumbing. A myocardial infarction (MI), or heart attack, is caused by a sudden blockage in the arteries that supply the heart muscle, known as the coronary arteries. Most of these blockages occur as a result of atherosclerosis, a process by which cholesterol and white blood cells accumulate in the wall of the artery (Figure). ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction. Management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI) (STEMI) relies on two essential and key components: rapid recognition and timely reperfusion. Therefore, systems must be placed and implemented to prevent delay in management of patients who develop STEMI. This is termed acute coronary syndrome and results in ischemia (restricted blood supply) and hypoxia (oxygen shortage) that can cause damage or necrosis (death) of the heart muscle tissue. There are two basic types of acute myocardial infarction: Myocardial Infarction, Non-ST-Segment Elevation (NSTEMI) – Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, Treatment and Ongoing care. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is considered to be closely related to the pathogenesis and clinical presentation of unstable angina (UA).

To identify a UTI, keep an eye out for the following symptoms: A burning feeling when you urinate A frequent or intense urge to urinate, even though little comes out when you do The symptoms of a bladder infection tend to come on suddenly and include: painful urination and a burning sensation; needing to urinate frequently; sudden urges to empty your bladder, called urinary urgency; pain in your central lower abdomen, just above the pubic bone; blood in your urine Urinary tract infection (UTI) symptoms may include burning sensation, strong urge to urinate, pain, urinary frequency, difficulty urinating, and sometimes, blood in the urine. Topics A-Z Slideshows Images Quizzes Medications Medical Dictionary A urinary tract infection happens when bacteria grow in the kidneys, bladder or urethra. The urethra is the tube that connects the bladder to the opening between the clitoris and the vagina so urine can exit the body. Once the bacteria settle in, they wreak havoc and can cause a laundry list of UTI symptoms that include: Pelvic or abdominal pain A classic sign of a UTI is feeling like you always need to go to the bathroom, even if you just went. You may also feel a sense of urgency—you need to go, and you need to go NOW. 2. Only being able to pee a little bit every time. When you go sit down to do your business, not much comes out. In uncomplicated cases, UTIs can be treated easily using antibiotics. In complicated cases, especially if the kidneys are affected, longer courses or medication may be required, depending upon the nature of complication. The following is a list of symptoms commonly associated with a Urinary Tract Infection. Anyone having these should get themselves checked for the same. 1. Burning Sensation During Urination. The most commonly experienced symptom across individuals with UTIs is a burning sensation during urination. Final Thoughts on UTI Symptoms. 50 percent of women have at least one urinary tract infection in their lifetimes, and about 20 percent have recurrent UTIs. The majority of UTIs are caused by the E. coli bacterium. 9 Symptoms of Urinary Tract Infection. ConditionsUrinary Tract Infection. Published on Monday, January 25th, 2016 @ 9:59 pm.

passage_text: (These foods and beverages can also cause the stools to become dark and red in colour). Some laxatives and prescription drugs can also be the cause of red urine. In some cases, blood in the urine stream can be a sign of a medical condition like bladder stones, an enlarged prostate or, in rare cases, kidney cancer. Both bacteria and viruses may cause urethritis. The same bacteria that cause urinary tract infections (E. coli) and some sexually transmitted diseases (chlamydia, gonorrhea) can lead to urethritis. Viral causes of urethritis include herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus. Other causes include: Urolithiasis refers to stones in any part of the urinary tract, including the kidneys, bladder or urethra. The stones can be called calculi. Spinal cord injuries that result in urinary incontinence, an enlarged prostate or recurring urinary tract infections are common causes of concentrated and stagnant urine. Pelvic pathologic conditions that can cause bleeding may include something growing in the uterus that should not be there, such as polyps, fibroids, hyperplasia, endometrial cancer, infection, sexually transmitted diseases (i.e., gonorrhea and chlamydia), and endometritis. Try to avoid foods and beverages that can cause bladder irritation. Stop eating certain foods, one at a time, to see if your symptoms get better. Reduce or stop consuming caffeine, chocolate, carbonated beverages, citrus drinks, and foods with a high level of vitamin C. With the correct diagnosis and treatment, urethritis most often clears up without further problems. However, urethritis can lead to long term damage to the urethra and scar tissue called urethral stricture. It can also cause damage to other urinary organs in both men and women. Orange urine: Some medications with blackberry or beetroot dyes or rhubarb, can cause the urine to be orange. Medical issues that can cause orange urine are dehydration and jaundice. Cloudy urine: This can be a sign of urinary tract infection (UTI) or kidney stones. For men, semen left in the urinary tract can also cause the urine to be cloudy or murky. Foamy urine: When ingesting too much protein, excessive foam can be produced in the urine. Excessive protein can lead to disorders of the kidneys and liver. Bacteria is the main cause of urinary tract infections, or UTIs, according to the American Urological Association. These infections happen more often in women then in men. This is because women have a shorter urinary tract than men, and their systems are susceptible to bacteria. The normal symptoms of UTIs are burning and pain while urinating, the need to urinate often, blood in the urine and sometimes a fever. There are many risk factors that can contribute to a UTI, such as using a lot of antibiotics, sex with multiple partners, bacteria from bowels and waiting too long to urinate. These foods can cause inflammation to the bladder and make symptoms of a UTI worse, says urologist Dr. Elizabeth Kavaler, author of A Seat on the Aisle, Please!. It is best to avoid bladder irritants until the UTI is gone. Interstitial cystitis is a long-term (chronic) problem in which pain, pressure, or burning is present in the bladder. It is also called painful bladder syndrome. The bladder is a hollow organ with a thin layer of muscle that stores urine. When your bladder fills up with urine, it sends a signal to your brain, telling the muscles to squeeze. In most people, these signals are not sent until your bladder is almost full.

passage_text: Spanish language heritage in Florida dates back to 1565, with the founding of Saint Augustine, Florida. Spanish was the first European language spoken in Florida. In 1821, after Mexico's War of Independence from Spain, Texas was part of the United Mexican States as the state of Coahuila y Tejas. In places like Portland Oregon, there are large communities of Hispanics. Many residents there speak mostly Spanish, some not learning English. Advertised jobs frequently require Spanish. The Spanish language has been present in what is now the United States since the 16th and 17th centuries, with the arrival of Spanish colonization in North America that would later become the states of Florida, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and California. It was then claimed by the Spanish Empire as part of Alta California in the larger territory of New Spain. Alta California became a part of Mexico in 1821 following its successful war for independence, but was ceded to the United States in 1848 after the Mexican–American War. After the incorporation of these states to the United States in the first half of the 19th century, the Spanish language was later reinforced in the country by the acquisition of Puerto Rico in 1898. So should Spanish be accepted as the US second language? The question regarding language is frequently in the news, including just within the past few weeks. Just recently ABC News examined President Obama’s assurance that illegal immigrants would not be insured under the new health care reform policies. In total, there were 36,995,602 people aged five or older in the United States who spoke Spanish at home (12.8% of the total U.S. population). Over half of the country's Spanish-speakers reside in California, Texas, and Florida. Spanish was the language spoken by the first permanent European settlers in North America. Spanish arrived in the territory of the modern United States with Ponce de León in 1513. First of all there is no official language at all in the United States, although some have clamored for the adoption of English as the standard. Recently a New Jersey Public Policy poll reported on the website U.S. English showed a majority of citizens of the state want English to be adopted as the official language. Yet in many places in the country applicants for jobs are required to be conversant not just in English but in Spanish as well. The Center for Applied Linguistics advocates children learning a language at an early age.

passage_text: What is Focalin XR? Dexmethylphenidate is a medication that is FDA approved for the treatment of ADHD in both adults and children. Its effects last about six hours, but in the XR (extended release) version, its effects last for about 12 hours after taking it.ocalin XR Minor Side Effects. Dexmethylphenidate causes many of the same minor side effects that all stimulants used for adult ADHD do. However, most of the time these minor side effects go away after a few weeks of treatment. Focalin XR contains dexmethylphenidate, which is very similar to methylphenidate (the active component of Concerta ® , Daytrana ® , Ritalin ® , Metadate ® , and Methylin ®). In fact, methylphenidate is actually a mixture of dexmethylphenidate and levomethylphenidate.ocalin XR capsules are specially designed to release half of the medication immediately, and to release the second half of the medication after approximately four hours. As a result, the medication can be taken just once a day. Focalin XR is a fast-acting medication. It will start to work within 30 minutes of taking a dose and last up to 12 hours. In general, you should take Focalin XR in the morning so that its ingredients can help manage the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) throughout the day.t will start to work within 30 minutes of taking a dose and last up to 12 hours.

Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride, the d-threo enantiomer of racemic methylphenidate hydrochloride, is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant. focalin XR's main ingredient causing psychotropic stimulation is methylphenidate, much like concerta. the stimulating effects of the drug typically last between at the very le … ast 4 hours and at the most 12 hours, depending on how you react to the drug and how well your body metabolizes it. once was forced to take focalin because people thought I had ADHD, (in actuality, I had asperger's syndrome,) and you probably won't get much effect from it, mostly the side effects. It's made for ADHD, so it makes you tired, and occasionally dizzy and some confuse this for vertigo. Focalin XR capsules contain tiny beads that contain the medication. Half of these are immediate-release beads, and the other half are delayed-release beads, which do not dissolve until they reach the small intestine (about four hours later).

That's essentially the first step they use to remove surface rust etc. when people get boat anchor chains re-galvanized. you don't need to remove the rust, the question should be how do i prevent more rust. Let me explain, chains are generally made from ferrous metal which will rust and wear over time, end of. The only thing you can do is prolong the life of your chain, then eventually replace it.Oil will resist a chain from rusting by limiting it's exposure to the elements.est Answer: Mount them on the tires and use the machine. Most of the rust will be gone after a few days use. Tire chains are made for function not beauty and little rust won't hurt a thing unless you figure to drive the tractor across your white living room carpet. Instructions. Scrub off any surface rust with a steel wool pad or old toothbrush to reach tight areas. Put on rubber gloves. Pour a commercial rust remover onto the steel wool pad.Apply the solvent to the rust on the chains. The acids in rust removers dissolve the rust after 10 to 15 minutes.Wipe the chain clean with paper towels.Apply a primer to the chains with a paintbrush.nstructions. Scrub off any surface rust with a steel wool pad or old toothbrush to reach tight areas. Put on rubber gloves. Pour a commercial rust remover onto the steel wool pad. 1 If you're using a lemon, cut it in half and sprinkle salt liberally over the inside. 2  Use this to scrub at the area. 3  The acidic and abrasive ingredients will clean the rust easily. 4  If you're using white vinegar, use your toothbrush to scrub the area with a paste made from the vinegar and sea salt. Be sure you don't leave any rust behind on metals, as it can spread. 2  For really stubborn rust, you may need to resort to applying a diluted mixture of ammonia (1 tsp per cup of warm water) and allowing the area to soak. 3  Rinse and repeat the steps on how to remove rust if needed. Try a lime and salt. Sprinkle salt over the rusted area so that it is thoroughly coated and then juice a lime over the top. Use as much juice as you can get, and allow the mixture to set for 2-3 hours before scrubbing off. Wash the rusted item with washing-up liquid rinse and carefully dry. 2  Mix about 25ml (a teaspoon is 5ml) of oxalic acid with 250ml of warm water. 3  Soak the item for approx 20 minutes or clean down the item with a cloth or brass brush. 4  Wash fully and dry the item when rust removal is finished. Step-by-Step Instructions. 1  Start by rinsing the area to remove as much rust as possible. ( 2 Don't worry about soap, cleaners, etc and never use harsh chemicals, such as dangerous bleach 3  .). If possible, I recommend soaking the rusted area for at least 30 seconds in the lemon juice or vinegar. Be sure you don't leave any rust behind on metals, as it can spread. 2  For really stubborn rust, you may need to resort to applying a diluted mixture of ammonia (1 tsp per cup of warm water) and allowing the area to soak. 3  Rinse and repeat the steps on how to remove rust if needed.

passage_text: Flash memory is nonvolatile, that is the memory card will not lose its data when removed from the device, and the cards can also be erased or reformatted and reused. For most consumers, when buying a memory card you have to consider price, capacity and compatibility. DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) The most common type of computer memory. DRAMs hold data for a relatively brief period of time and need to be refreshed at regular intervals. DRAMs are measured by access time (in nanoseconds, or ns) and storage capacity (in megabytes, or MB). Generally, when one is adding memory to a computer, it is in the form of a SIMM. Early SIMMs handled 8 data bits at a time in a 30-pin configuration; later, when CPUs were processing 32-bits, newer generation SIMMs were constructed in a 72-pin configuration. Mainly used in mobile phones and other small handheld devices the MicroSD format is currently available in capacities up to 4GB, and it roughly 1/4th the size of the SD card at 15mm W 11mm W 0.7mm. The MicroSD card is also the smallest memory card available. There are three types of PCMCIA cards. All three have the same rectangular size (85.6 by 54 millimeters), but different widths: Type I cards can be up to 3.3 mm thick, and are used primarily for adding additional ROM or RAM to a computer. Type II cards can be up to 5.5 mm thick. These are the types of computer memory that are permanent and portable. These types of computer memory works like records and hard drives. However, instead of the head and arm, a laser light writes and reads the information on the CDs and DVDs to interpret it and display them in the monitor. Other types of computer memory include cache memory which is a type of RAM with a high response rate as far as data accessibility is concerned and flash memory which can be erased and programmed as per the user’s needs. They include the USB flash and the memory cards. Hard Disk Drive. The hard disk drives are among the most common types of computer memory. They can store the data and information long term as this is where you store your music, games, documents, and the like. Hard drives work much like records. They are spinning platters that have arms with head to touch the different parts of it. The card was designed based on the PCMCIA PC Card standard and can fit into a PCMCIA slot with an adapter. There are two types of CompactFlash cards to accommodate different capacities: 1  Type I cards are 42.8mm x 36.4mm x 3.3 mm thick. 2  Type II cards are 42.8mm x 36.4mm x 5.5 mm thick. SODIMM (Small Outline Dual In-Line Memory Module) SODIMMs are generally found in notebook computers and are smaller than standard DIMMs. In general, there are 2 types of SODIMMs the first handling 32 data bits at a time with a 72-pin configuration, and the second handling 64 data bits with a 144-pin configuration.

passage_text: Because anxiety and heart attack symptoms can be similar, it's best to seek immediate medical attention if you aren't sure which is being caused by anxiety in which by the heart. Fortunately, most medical professionals can easily tell the difference between anxiety symptoms and heart attack symptoms. If your doctor says your symptoms are being caused by anxiety, you can feel confident that your doctor's diagnosis is correct. So anxiety symptoms can coexist with heart attack symptoms. And, being anxious can aggravate heart attack symptoms. While there are some ways to tell the difference, it's best to seek immediate medical attention if you are concerned that you are having a heart attack. One reason may be that the types of traumas that women experience most—sexual trauma and rape—are more likely to lead to post-traumatic stress disorder. PTSD is one of the many types of anxiety that can put stress on the heart. The role of genes in anxiety disorder “Just like a major heart attack, a burn is a horrible thing, says Dr. McCann. Anxiety Symptoms Or Symptoms Of A Heart Attack? The differences between anxiety and a heart attack: Anxiety and heart attack signs and symptoms Heart attack signs and symptoms: Chest discomfort or pain. Upper body pain (shoulders, arms, back, neck, jaw, teeth, etc.). Stomach pain. Shortness of breath. Anxiety. Lightheadedness or dizziness. Sweating. Those heart attack symptoms can certainly happen to women, but many experience vague or even “silent” symptoms that they may miss. These six heart attack symptoms are common in women: Chest pain or discomfort. Chest pain is the most common heart attack symptom, but some women may experience it differently than men. It may feel like a squeezing or fullness, and the pain can be anywhere in the chest, not just on the left side. It's usually truly uncomfortable during a heart attack, says cardiologist Rita Redberg, MD, director of Women’s Cardiovascular Services at the University of California, San Francisco. Anxiety disorders come with a high degree of fear and uncertainty. When this fear and certainty keeps the heart attack or heart disease patient from following the advice and treatment plan of their cardiologist, it can have a major impact on recovery. Anxiety can interfere with: Sticking to prescribed exercise regimens; Taking prescribed medications Some of the signs and symptoms of anxiety: 1  Chest tightness or pain. 2  Upper body pain (or pain anywhere in the body). 3  Stomach upset and pain. 4  Shortness of breath. 5  Palpitations. 6  Anxiety. 7  Lightheadedness or dizziness. 8  Sweating. 9  Nausea and vomiting. 10  Feel like passing out. 11  Unusual fatigue or exhaustion. For more information about the many signs and symptoms of anxiety and anxiety attacks, see our anxiety symptoms page. As you can see, some of the signs and symptoms of anxiety and the signs and symptoms of a heart attack are similar.

Upper body pain (shoulders, arms, back, neck, jaw, teeth, etc.). Stomach pain. Shortness of breath. Anxiety. The effect of anxiety on the heart. When someone is anxious, their body reacts in ways that can put an extra strain on their heart. The physical symptoms of anxiety can be especially damaging among individuals with existing cardiac disease.

passage_text: When cannabis is ingested by mouth, THC levels peak after 1 to 6 hours. When inhaled, cannabinoids such as THC are rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream with a peak concentration in 2 to 10 minutes. On average, the effects of marijuana last 3 – 4 hours. Analyzing our drug test submission data. The charts and passing percentile trendlines that follow below were quantitatively derived from the urine drug test results of thousands of marijuana users who submitted their drug test results to us. They represent the four common factors that determine how long. Hi RJ. Yes, you should be OK for one time ingestion of marijuana 10 days before a drug screen. In other words, THC is usually detectable for 3-4 days after one time use….and 10 days after you eat marijuana is a long enough time for THC to clear the system. How long can a drug test detect cannabis usage? Use our Marijuana Drug Test Calculator to determine your odds of passing your next drug test! In an effort to provide the community with the most accurate answer to this question, we set up a simple submission form where people. The half life for THC is long, because THC is stored in the body’s fat cells (THC is highly lipid and not easily dissolved in water). Therefore, the blood plasma and urinary half-life of THC are best estimated at 3 – 4 days after ingestion. At this time, there is no simple answer to the question: How long does pot stay in your system? That’s because THC, the psychoactive element in marijuana, is fat-soluble, not water-soluble. If THC was water-soluble, all traces would be gone from the body within days. So if you're wondering how long weed stays in your system, it depends on things like how often you smoke or eat edibles, your weight and exercise level, as well as other lifestyle factors. (Joe Amon, Denver Post file) While THC COOH has no psychoactive effects, it can be detected in your urine for weeks, even months. It is not a marker for current impairment, so it is arguably useless, but nevertheless, THC COOH has become the standard of evidence for determining if you test positive for marijuana use. Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a cannabinoid found in cannabis, is psychoactive and credited for creating euphoric and psychoactive effects. Your urine is used to test for the amount of just one of the metabolites of THC. A metabolite is basically a chemical produced by the body from another chemical taken in by the body. The metabolite they are looking for is THC COOH. So that’s the short answer: It could take more than three months before a person has cleared evidence of cannabis use from his or her system.

passage_text: Clear coat is that all-important barrier which protects your car's paint from the cruel world around it. When properly applied to your car's base coat, clear coat will block harmful UV rays that can cause fading, protect against chips and scratches, and provide a glossier finish than any single-stage auto paint. Wet sanding gives way to spray. Once the car is dry, re-spray clear coat with a paint gun, making sure to apply it smoothly. Never brush on clear coat, as bristles will leave marks in the coat and make the car look scratched. Once the coat is dry, wax for a shiny finish. Clear coat: Spraying it on. Most vehicles have a base color coat that is covered with a clear coat of paint over it. The clear coat is the layer that is directly exposed to harmful and damaging conditions like: Age of the vehicle’s paint job. Aspen’s cold winters. Ultra violet rays of the sun. Irregular car washing and waxing. The problem is that your car might be the victim of a faulty paint job in the first place at the factory. We’ve seen this in lots of cars built in the early-to-mid nineties. In those cases, the paint and clear coat just weren’t compatible and started to separate over time. The clear coat is the layer that is directly exposed to harmful and damaging conditions like: 1  Age of the vehicle’s paint job. 2  Aspen’s cold winters. 3  Ultra violet rays of the sun.  Irregular car washing and waxing. However, if the scratch cannot be removed by wet sanding, here’s what you’ll need to re-spray clear coat: 1  A covered garage. 2  Wood or rubber block. 3  1,500- to 3,000-grit sandpaper. 4  Adhesive. Bucket. 5  Water. A few drops of mild dish 6  soap. Auto  wax. 1  Paint gun. Clear coat resin  paint. Towels. If you have large patches of peeling all over your car, though, you would be better off having your car repainted. How deep is the peeling? Clear coat is one thing, but if the paint below it is peeling, that’s another story. A typical car first has a layer of primer, then paint, and then a top clear coat. Once the paint below the clear coat is damaged, new paint will be necessary. Be sure to wait 10 minutes between each application of clear coat. After the final coat is applied, it will be about 1 hour before the surface is safe to touch. It is strongly recommended that you wait 30 days before waxing, buffing or taking the treated car through a carwash. On hot days, try painting in the shade, late at night, or early in the morning. For cold days, head for a heated garage. Try to avoid high humidity whenever possible. NEVER paint in direct sunlight. If your clear coat becomes foggy, chances are you have a temperature or humidity issue. Quick Answer. To repair a scratch in the clear coat, first clean the car panel with warm soapy water. For scratches that have only penetrated the clear coat, the scratch can be carefully sanded out. After sanding the clear coating, the scratched area needs to be replaced. Continue Reading.

passage_text: For anyone who hasn't been in hypersleep for the last 25 years, this series needs no introduction, though for the first time each film now comes in both original and special edition form. Alien (1979) was so perfect it didn't need fixing, and Ridley Scott's 2003 director's cut is fiddling for the sake of fiddling. The world’s earliest surviving motion-picture film, showing actual consectuve action is called Roundhay Garden Scene. It’s a short film directed by French inventor Louis Le Prince. While it’s just 2.11 seconds long, it is technically a movie. According to the Guineness Book of Records, it is the oldest surviving film in existence. 1  Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Click to print (Opens in new window) No date is given in Alien for the action, save that it happens in the 22nd Century (due to the presence of a crew uniform patch that says, 'Flag of the United Americas 2104 to present'). In Aliens Carter Burke orders the colonists to investigate the crashed Engineer ship on 12 June '79. Assuming Aliens happens in 2179, then Alien takes place 57 years earlier, in 2122 (and this was later confirmed in featurettes in the Alien Legacy boxed set). From a computer display at the start of Alien, the movie starts on 3 June. Thus, Prometheus concludes 28 years, 5 months and 2 days before the start of Alien. It’s a short film directed by French inventor Louis Le Prince. While it’s just 2.11 seconds long, it is technically a movie. According to the Guineness Book of Records, it is the oldest surviving film in existence. Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) It’s been 69 years since that air raid, yet what actually happened remains a mystery, one that the creative team behind the movie was excited to use as a jumping-off point: It wasn’t enemies from across an ocean surreptitiously flying over the coast. These were aliens from another world, with even more nefarious plans. Mark Easter of the Mutual UFO Network, a group that investigates UFOs, expects to see an uptick in reported sightings in the coming months, precisely because of the release of “Battle: Los Angeles.” He said alien-invasion-themed movies tend to cause a spike in the average of about 600 sightings sent to MUFON each month.

The pilot landed on LV-426 and was killed, within a couple of hundred years of the destruction of the LV-223 facility (so between 1,800 and 2,200 years before the events of Alien). The fact that the facehugger eggs could survive and remain viable for that time period is impressive. Feb. 25, 2011 | 6:39 p.m. Sony’s upcoming alien invasion flick “Battle: Los Angeles” posits an apocalyptic scenario in which the City of Angels is the last of the world’s major cities left standing after marauding extraterrestrials invade from the heavens. It’s also based on a true story.

passage_text: It will be seen also that the situation was novel. Deaths were by no means uncommon in Roaring Camp, but a birth was a new thing. People had been dismissed the camp effectively, finally, and with no possibility of return; but this was the first time that anybody had been introduced AB INITIO. Hence the excitement. Bret Harte and His Life. Bret Harte is best known for the short stories he wrote about the Gold Rush and the American West. Harte, according to some, reinvented the American short story and laid the foundation for the Western novel. The Luck of Roaring Camp. The Luck of Roaring Camp is a short story by American author Bret Harte. It was first published in the August 1868 issue of the Overland Monthly and helped push Harte to international prominence. The story is about the birth of a baby boy in a 19th-century gold prospecting camp. The Luck of Roaring Camp Summary. In an isolated California mining camp during the gold-rush days, the whole camp is astounded and intrigued at the birth of a baby to a sinful woman named Cherokee Sal, who died at the child’s birth. The main attraction of the magazine, however, were the stories that Harte wrote for it, including The Luck of Roaring Camp, The Outcasts of Poker Flat, Tennessee's Partner, and others. These stories, published in book form in the East, made Harte's reputation, and are considered the peak of his literary career. For the Canadian professional wrestler, see Bret Hart.

They are essential macro molecules made of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. Biological significance of carbohydrates in living organisms is as follows: 1  Carbohydrates are energy stores of animals and plants. 2  Carbohydrates are immediate source of energy while lipids are long-term source of energy. Of course, your body doesn't run on gasoline-it runs on carbohydrates. Carbohydrates, found in foods like grains, fruits, beans, milk products and vegetables, are by far your body's favorite source of energy, yet providing your body with pep is not the only role carbs play. Biological significance of carbohydrates in living organisms is as follows: 1  Carbohydrates are energy stores of animals and plants. 2  Carbohydrates are immediate source of energy while lipids are long-term source of energy. 1 In plants they are used as energy source and for storage in the form of starch. 2  Cellulose which is a polysaccharide is an important structural component in the cell wall of plants. 3  Sucrose, a disaccharide is a product of photosynthesis and is transported internally. Carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are the main energy source for the human body. Chemically, carbohydrates are organic molecules in which carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen bond together in the ratio: C x (H 2 O) y, where x and y are whole numbers that differ depending on the specific carbohydrate to which we are referring. Carbohydrates and lipids can both be used as energy storage however carbohydrates are usually used for short term storage whereas lipids are used for long term storage. Carbohydrates are soluble in water unlike lipids. Glucose is the only sugar used by the body to provide energy for its tissues. Therefore, all digestible polysaccharides, disaccharides, and monosaccharides must eventually be converted into glucose or a metabolite of glucose by various liver enzymes. Starch is a polymer of the monosaccharide glucose: Starch is the principal polysaccharide used by plants to store glucose for later use as energy. Plants often store starch in seeds or other specialized organs; for example, common sources of starch include rice, beans, wheat, corn, potatoes, and so on.

passage_text: A few hours generally wont hurt you unless you're already susceptible to imbalances in your gastrointestinal system. The real concern comes when you do finally go. Holding it in too much for too long can lead to compacted stool, constipation, and reabsorbtion of the toxins in your poop back into your body. Compacted stools can lead to painful and/or damaging bowel movements, tearing of the sphincter, and hemorrhoids. Many medications contribute to it. Tx is to increase fluid intake, increase fiber or fiber supplements( fibercon) stool softeners , and 3xwk or if no bowel movement in 3 days. Digital disimpaction may be necessary if hard stool present in anus or rectum with or w/o enemas. ...Read more. my question is in regards to bowel movements! i go too many times! and have pain in rectum at times! u sed to have blood in stools, but now! no blood, but constant urge to go! stools fel very hard ,and have hard time getting them out! i keep thinking bowel obstruction but have no clue! they are not!! loose! bottom line: i spend too much time on ... If you have frequent bowel movements, consume only the daily recommended amounts of fiber -- 25 and 38 grams for women and men under age of 50, respectively, and 21 and 30 grams for women and men over age of 50, respectively. Add fiber, such as that in whole-grain bread, slowly to your diet in order to prevent abdominal discomfort. Medical experts often recommend eating fiber to help regulate bowel movements; however, consuming too much fiber too quickly can lead to more bowel movements than normal or to frequent bowel movements. A medical definition is bowel infrequency (less than one bowel movement every 3-4 days). I know of no patient who died due to bowel infrequency. On the other hand, an obstructed colon that ruptures, leaks, infarcts can be life threatening if the obstruction is not relieved. Blood after a bowel movement is never normal- it is a sign that something is going on. Any bleeding from the rectal area should be checked out by a health care professional. While the small amount of blood on the toilet paper after hard BMs probably is from hemorrhoids, the clots you describe are more concerning. What Is the Right Frequency of Bowel Movements? It's a myth that the definition of a normal bowel movement is having 1 movement each day because that is not true for everyone. There is no rule for frequency of bowel movements, but the general range is from 3 times a day to 3 times a week. Less than 3 movements a week may indicate constipation, and more than 3 watery stools a day could indicate diarrhea. Not so much.: Everyone has some changeability in bowel habits, and sometimes a certain food will cause the runs. However, if you frequently have 5 or more stools daily, you should see your doctor. Review your diet, medical history, and medications. If you see blood, that definitely should be evaluated. ...Read more. I have fought with constipation my whole life and will have blood on the toilet paper after a hard movement. Last week, I had blood and some clots on the paper but my movement wasn't that hard. It lasted one day and then I had nothing until five days later...the same thing happened. It is only on the toilet paper when I wipe, not on my underwear. I do have a doctor appointment but am very concerned.

passage_text: Peyronie’s disease is a disorder in which scar tissue, called a plaque, forms in the penis—the male organ used for urination and sex. The plaque builds up inside the tissues of a thick, elastic membrane called the tunica albuginea. The most common area for the plaque is on the top or bottom of the penis. Kidney Scarring Symptoms. 1  The most common and primary sign of a scarred kidney is proteinuria. 2  Proteinuria is a condition wherein proteins pass through to the urine. 3  When protein is allowed to escape in the urine, this can cause edema in different parts of the body. Many diseases and conditions can affect your kidney function by attacking and damaging the glomeruli, the tiny filtering units inside your kidney where blood is cleaned. These diseases and conditions are called glomerular diseases and can have many different causes. Focal Segmental glomerulosclerosis is a type of glomerular disease and describes scarring (sclerosis) in your kidney. The scarring of FSGS only takes place in small sections of each glomerulus (filter), and only a limited number of glomeruli are damaged at first. Kidney scarring occurs in the small blood vessels in the kidneys known as glomeruli, and thus it is also known as glomerulosclerosis. The cause of it is often unknown, but in many cases, it is the result of an infection, a disease, excess toxins or drug abuse. Causes of Kidney Scarring. 1  Kidney scarring can result from a variety of diseases involving the kidney. 2  Glomerulosclerosis is also a scarring of the kidneys but affects the glomeruli or filter of the kidney. 3  With Glomerulosclerosis, the disease often results from systemic diseases such lupus or diabetes. Urethral stricture. A urethral stricture is a narrowing of the urethra caused by injury, instrumentation, infection and certain non-infectious forms of urethritis. Contents. Causes of Kidney Scarring. 1  Kidney scarring can result from a variety of diseases involving the kidney. This can include urinary tract infections and even diabetes. 2  Glomerulosclerosis is also a scarring of the kidneys but affects the glomeruli or filter of the kidney. How Kidney Disease and Scar Tissue Work. The primary function of the kidneys is to rid the body of the waste produced through the breakdown of protein. This produces the main waste product of urea, which is normally passed out of the body in the urine. The scar tissue builds up and forms a plaque inside the penis. The plaque reduces the elasticity of tissues and flexibility of the penis during erection, leading to curvature. The plaque may further harden because of calcification––the process in which calcium builds up in body tissue.

passage_text: Depending on the type of NiCd charger you have, the older NiCd charger may undercharge NiMH batteries (most likely), it may overcharge them (less likely), or it may charge NiMH batteries properly (but it's not likely to do so automatically and could take a very long time). Let's take a look at the three cases. If our professionals cannot repair your device, there is no charge. Call Cellairis right away if your iPhone, Smartphone, tablet or other device is not functioning up to par. You will find certified technicians ready to diagnose your damage and repair your device promptly. At Cellairis, we never charge you if your device is not repaired exactly as you had expected. Simply divide the capacity of the battery by the charge rate of the charger, then increase the amount of time by about 20% to allow for a certain amount of inefficiency. As an example, a battery with a capacity of 1600 mAh will require about 4 hours to be fully charged by a charger with a charge rate of 500 mA. Typically a 5 hour NiCd charger has a switch that allows the charge time to be increased from five hours to eight hours. Thus a 5 hour NiCd charger becomes an 8 hour NiMh charger. As we mentioned above, we do not recommend this type of charger design. Fast charge: Repeated fast charges on a battery may overcharge a battery and reduce service life. Step 1: Determine how long to recharge a battery by calculating how much capacity your battery has. For example, an Interstate battery with the part number MT-34 has 120 minutes reserve capacity. Cellairis offers the industry best warranty on our repair work. Most iPhone Repairs and iPad Repairs are done while you wait and completed in just minutes. Our certified technicians provide precision service and the utmost care on your device. Q: Why are there two output slots on the instaCHARGE? A: The instaCHARGE is equipped with two outputs: 5V 1A and 5V 2.1A. The 5V 1A is primarily used to charge smaller devices like your cell phone or MP3. The 5V 2.1A is primarily used to charge larger devices like your tablet because it needs more power to charge. The 5V 2.1A may also be used to charge smaller devices like your cell phone or MP3. If the 5V 2.1A port is used to charge a smaller device, you will notice a remarkable increase in speeding charge. ALMOST HALF THE TIME OF USING THE 5V 1A PORT WITH SOME DEVICES. Q: My instaCHARGE won’t charge my tablet using the 5V 1A port. Usually it takes several hours to effectively recharge a battery. If a battery is very discharged then it can take up to 12 hours or more to recharge it. While recharging a battery, if the battery becomes hot when you touch it then stop charging it. Slow charge: It is best to slow charge the battery. Slow charging rates vary depending on the battery's type and capacity. A charger that can charge a standard capacity AAA NiCD battery (180 mAh) in just one hour might take 8 hours to charge a high capacity NiMH (1500 mAh) battery. It's best to ignore such terms and make a rough calculation of how fast a charger can charge batteries. A: No. Each unit should be fully charged when you receive your unit. You should be able to use it immediately out of the box. If for some reason it is not, please follow the instructions in your manual to charge it. Please call our 800 line if you have any questions.

passage_text: How long will an average size central air conditioner... I want to know how long central air condensers last. I clean my condnser with simple green once or twice before the winter. Air Conditioner Use. Like anything else with moving parts, the more you use your air conditioner, the faster it’s going to break down. No matter how good the unit, the more it runs, the sooner it will need to be replaced. If your air conditioner is struggling to get enough air to recycle or can’t cool the home efficiently because of poorly designed ducts, it’s going to run too often, shortening its life. Another big problem with air ducts in Phoenix is that attics can easily reach 165+ degrees. The Biggest Factors in Air Conditioner Lifespans. Certain factors can influence how long your air conditioner survives, including the size of the air conditioner unit, your duct design, the amount of use and how much maintenance your unit receives. A heating, ventilation and air conditioning system is probably one of the biggest investments you'll ever make in your home. As such, you may be wondering how long this important investment will last. To some extent, this is akin to forecasting the lifespan of a human being. 10 to 20 years - sometimes longer. You should have a service tech come out once a year for a tune up. You wouldn't run your car without regular maintenance and tune ups and you shouldn't run your a/c that way either - if you want it to last as long as possible. Source(s): 20 years working for a major manufacturer of central heating and air conditioning. Yes, you can review actuarial tables for a general idea, but much depends on regular care and maintenance. Heating and air conditioning professionals often tell clients that under “normal” operating conditions, their HVAC system could last between 15 and 25 years. Furnaces tend to outlast air conditioners; cooling units can last up to 20 years, while furnaces can last up to 25 years. Survey the Odds. Heating and air conditioning professionals often tell clients that under “normal” operating conditions, their HVAC system could last between 15 and 25 years. Furnaces tend to outlast air conditioners; cooling units can last up to 20 years, while furnaces can last up to 25 years. The all-important factor in these ranges is regular maintenance. We also have some units that lasted 6-10 years and failed. It all depends on make. usage and maintance of the unit. If you opt for a new A/C system, the installation company will try and sell you a system based on the new and expensive R410 refrigerant. How long can a Trane last? Im in the market for a new AC/furnace. We built the home 20 years ago and the builder put in a Comfortmaker furnace and I dont know the brand of AC. I have fixed the furnace myself a couple times including a bad board a few years ago. Im an industrial electrician but not a HVAC guy. Last year the AC got warm and had to be charged. This summer same and it took 4 pounds. I can see the end is near and after 20 years I think it had a good run. I have gotten quotes from Trane, Carrier, Bryant and the Lennox dealer was a no show.
